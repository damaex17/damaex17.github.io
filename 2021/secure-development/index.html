margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;" /></p> <h3 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h3> <p>Software Developers use programming languages to develop software. This chapter takes a look at the different types of languages and the security implications.</p> <p>The instructions that a computer processes are a long series of binary digits in a language known as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine code</a></em>. It’s a language of 0s and 1s and no human can understand anything but the simplest instructions without the assistance of specialized software.</p> <p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembler</a></em> is a higher-level language to represent the machine code. It’s still a complex and obscure way of programming and requires specific knowledge about the hardware it will interact with.</p> <p>While there are some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Current_usage">situations</a> in which developers might choose to use assembly language, the preference is to use <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">high-level languages</a></em>, such as Java, Ruby, Python, R, and C++.</p> <p>These languages are feature-rich and provide standards for common tasks, permit debugging, and maintain architectural agnosticism.</p> <h3 id="compiled-vs-interpreted">Compiled vs. Interpreted</h3> <p>When using a <em>compiled language</em> like C or Java, a tool known as a compiler converts the higher-level language into an executable file that is distributed and designed to be used on a specific operating system. It is not possible to directly view or modify the software instructions in such a compiled executable.</p> <p><strong>The term reverse engineering describes the act of using a decompiler to reconstruct the source code from an executable. This is useful for malware analysis or intelligence gathering, where access to the original source code is not available.</strong></p> <p>Languages like Python, R, and JavaScript are <em>interpreted languages</em>. Developers distribute these programs by sharing the source code with all instructions. End-users use an interpreter to execute the source code on their system.</p> <p>Compiled and interpreted languages both have advantages and disadvantages from a security perspective. Compiled code is less likely to be manipulated by a third party, but security flaws or backdoors in the source code are harder to detect since the original instructions can’t be accessed by the end-user.</p> <p>Interpreted code on the other hand is very transparent because the end-user can read the code before executing it in an interpreter. The disadvantage is that everyone who touches the software can introduce malicious instructions.</p> <h3 id="object-oriented-programming">Object-Oriented Programming</h3> <p>OOP is a standard based on the concept of “objects” and focuses on the interaction of such objects rather than on a series of steps as seen in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>. Many modern programming languages (such as Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and support OOP.</p> <p>Object-Oriented programming is generally speaking more reliable and reduces the propagation of errors in a system. From a security perspective, OOP is a black-box abstraction because users don’t need to know the inner working of an object but rather the details and abilities of the interface to an object.</p> <p>The desired characteristic in OOP is the self-containment of an object or in other works the encapsulation. Below are some core concepts of object-oriented programming.</p> <p><strong>Message</strong> is commonly used in OOP to describe the input of an object.</p> <p><strong>Method</strong> this is the name for the instructions (or code) of an object. It specifies the actions in response to a message.</p> <p><strong>Class</strong> is a collection of methods and acts as a template for the creation of objects.</p> <p><strong>Delegation</strong> describes the forwarding of a request an object receives to another object. Objects delegate if they don’t have a method to handle certain requests.</p> <p><strong>Polymorphism</strong> is the characteristic of an object to respond differently to the same message because of changes in external parameters. This can be static polymorphism during compile time or dynamic polymorphism during runtime (JVM).</p> <p><strong>Cohesion</strong> is the degree of focus of a method (or class). Low cohesion means an unfocused variety of actions and low specialization.</p> <p><strong>Coupling</strong> describes the level of interaction between objects. High coupling of objects means low independence.</p> <p>High cohesion and loose coupling is an important principle in software engineering. It results in strong focus and high independence and is desired for objects (and development teams).</p> </div> <span><div style="text-align:center">[ <a href="/tag/technology/"><code class="highlighter-rouge"><nobr>technology</nobr></code></a> <a href="/tag/security/"><code class="highlighter-rouge"><nobr>security</nobr></code></a> ]</div></span> <aside class="share"> <div style="text-align:center"><p>If you liked this article, please share it on <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Secure Development - Programming Languages.
