It makes a lot of sense to measure what users like and only build what people want to use.</h5> <p>But the collected data can be very sensitive and undermine the rights of users if a data loss occurs. Data privacy laws, therefore, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/">dictate</a> appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p> <p>Many organizations can’t afford highly restricted environments and are left with either limited data analytics or the risk of a data leak and resulting <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/fines-penalties/">penalties</a>.</p> <p>One way to protect data subjects and combine business needs with user rights is anonymization and in this article, we’ll gonna take a look at it.</p> <h3 id="history">History</h3> <p>One of the oldest methods of anonymization is the removal (suppression) of direct personal identifiers from the data such as names or phone numbers.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/anon_1.png" alt="anonymization by removing the name" style="float: left; width:60%; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;" /></p> <p>Until 1997, the resulting dataset was considered more or less anonymized and hospitals in the US, for example, released such data to the public.</p> <p>But then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latanya_Sweeney">Latanya Sweeney</a> entered the stage and conducted a re-identification experiment.</p> <p>She <a href="https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf">successfully</a> re-identified individuals by combining public medical records with other accessible records.</p> <p>The “linkage attack” was born, where adversaries collect information from multiple data sources and then combine that data to re-create personally identifiable information.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/anon_2.png" alt="linkage attack" style="float: left; width:45%; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;" /></p> <p>Latanya Sweeney conducted more research on re-identification and was met with publication challenges. The fear was that she is publicly exposing a serious issue with no known solution.</p> <p>In 2017, Forbes named Sweeney one of the most influential women in technology.</p> <p>The concept of removing names and direct identifiers is considered pseudonymization if at all. Working with this data requires organizations to control the risk of a data breach since disclosure would affect the users rights.</p> <h3 id="anonymization">Anonymization</h3> <p>Today, organizations have to provide evidence for anonymization since it exempts the business from strict data-privacy requirements. It has to be clearly documented why data subjects can no longer be identified directly or indirectly from the dataset.</p> <p>Most successful anonymization efforts involve the application of multiple techniques.</p> <h3 id="k-anonymity-protection-model">K-Anonymity protection model</h3> <p>The concept of k-anonymity was first introduced by Latanya Sweeney and Pierangela Samarati in a <a href="https://dataprivacylab.org/dataprivacy/projects/kanonymity/kanonymity.pdf">paper</a> published in 1998.</p> <p><em>Data is said to have the k-anonymity property if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k - 1 individuals whose information also appear in the release.</em></p> <p>The more personal attributes in a dataset, the harder it is to accomplish k-anonymity over all the attributes combined. Let’s consider this table of fictitious patient records.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/anon_3.png" alt="fictitious nonanonymized patient records" style="left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;" /></p> <p>The two common methods to support k-anonymity are:</p> <p><strong>Suppression</strong> means that the values of attributes are replaced by a wildcard.</p> <p><strong>Generalization</strong> describes the replacement of individual values of attributes to a broader category.</p> <p>In the following table we accomplished a 2-anonymity with respect to ‘Age’ and “Gender’ since for any combination of these attributes there are always at least 2 rows with the same value.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/anon_4.png" alt="patient records with 2-anonymity" style="left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;" /></p> <p>The attributes ‘Age’ and ‘Gender’ are quasi-identifiers and when combined, can support re-identification to yield personally-identifying information. Each tuple of quasi-identifiers has to occur at least in k records of a dataset to accomplish k-anonymity.</p> <p>K-anonymity is a promising approach for group-based anonymization given its simplicity, it is however susceptible to attacks. When background knowledge is available an attacker can use it to re-identify people. In the above example, background knowledge about the disease can support an attack on the anonymity of individuals.</p> <p>Given the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred from k-anonymity data, the following methods have been created to further k-anonymity by additionally maintaining the diversity and closeness of sensitive fields.</p> <p><strong>The l-diversity Principle</strong> An equivalence class is said to have l-diversity if there are at least l “well-represented” values for the sensitive attribute. A table is said to have l-diversity if every equivalence class of the table has l-diversity.</p> <p><strong>The t-closeness Principle</strong> An equivalence class is said to have t-closeness if the distance between the distribution of a sensitive attribute in this class and the distribution of the attribute in the whole table is no more than a threshold t. A table is said to have t-closeness if all equivalence classes have t-closeness.</p> <h3 id="differential-privacy">Differential Privacy</h3> <p>This technique was developed by cryptographers and draws much of its language from cryptography. Simply put differential privacy introduces two methods to balance data usefulness and privacy protection.</p> <p>First, an algorithm injects random noise into a data set to protect the privacy of an individual. The noise is small enough to enable analysts and researchers to provide useful insights.</p> <p>Secondly, the amount of information revealed is calculated and deducted from a so-called privacy-loss budget. The reference book for differential privacy is “<a href="https://www.amazon.de/Algorithmic-Foundations-Differential-Theoretical-Computer/dp/1601988184/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Algorithmic+Foundations+of+Differential+Privacy%22&amp;qid=1596537123&amp;sr=8-1">The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy</a>” by Aaron Roth.</p> <p>Apple has released a <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing <em>local differential privacy</em>. The interesting twist here is that the noise is added on the users’ smartphone even before the data is sent to the Apple backend servers.</p> <p>An interesting approach we have been discussing in the posting <a href="/2020/privacy-client-shift/">System Architecture - Shift To The Client</a>.</p> <h3 id="recap">Recap</h3> <p>The challenge of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history. As data about individuals is more detailed than ever, the need for a robust approach to data anonymization is no longer optional.</p> <p>The clever matching of different data collections and resulting de-anonymization threatens any approach. Organizations have to innovate and underline how they handle the obtained user data responsibly.</p> </div> <div id="291704505"> <script type="text/javascript"> try { window._mNHandle.queue.push(function (){ window._mNDetails.loadTag("291704505", "320x50", "291704505"); }); } catch (error) {} </script> </div> <span><div style="text-align:center">[ <a href="/tag/technology/"><code class="highlighter-rouge"><nobr>technology</nobr></code></a> <a href="/tag/security/"><code class="highlighter-rouge"><nobr>security</nobr></code></a> <a href="/tag/privacy/"><code class="highlighter-rouge"><nobr>privacy</nobr></code></a> ]</div></span> <aside class="share"> <div style="text-align:center"><p>If you liked this article, please share it on <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Data Anonymization.
