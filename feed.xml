&lt;p&gt;Innovation in AI technology brings newfound capabilities to hackers, as well as promising solutions to counter those threats - making it a critical factor in shaping the future of digital security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/AI-cyber.png&quot; alt=&quot;GPT created image with prompt: Opportunities and threats of AI to cybersecurity&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-ai-powered-cyberattacks&quot;&gt;The rise of AI-powered cyberattacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of AI-powered cyberattacks has led to a significant transformation in the threat landscape, posing new and severe challenges in the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prominent example of these attacks is the use of automated techniques, where cybercriminals deploy AI algorithms to rapidly identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems at an unprecedented scale, making it increasingly difficult for organizations to maintain their security posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another unsettling instance is the advancement of deepfake technology, which leverages artificial neural networks to convincingly manipulate audio and visual content, thus facilitating the dissemination of misinformation. The integration of deepfake technology with AI-driven social engineering attacks further exacerbates the problem, as it enables malicious actors to easily impersonate individuals to manipulate employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the combination of AI and social engineering has led to more sophisticated spear-phishing campaigns, where personalized messages significantly increase the likelihood of a successful breach. Often, these messages are crafted by extracting personal information from social media or data breaches employing AI-powered analytics, thereby exploiting human vulnerabilities with remarkable precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-powered-cybersecurity-solutions&quot;&gt;AI-powered cybersecurity solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter these sophisticated threats, organizations must not only rely on traditional methods but also leverage AI capabilities to enhance their security strategies. By integrating AI tools and techniques, organizations are not only mitigating risks but also staying one step ahead of the evolving cyber landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key innovations in AI-powered cybersecurity solutions include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anomaly Detection: By utilizing machine learning algorithms, security teams can identify unusual patterns in network traffic, detect threats in real-time, and act swiftly to prevent potential breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predictive Analytics: AI-powered predictive analytics offer remarkable insights by anticipating attacks, forecasting vulnerabilities, and enabling proactive measures to minimize the risk of successful cyber offensives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incident Response Automation: AI-driven automation of incident response enables more efficient prioritization and triaging of security events. This increased efficiency allows security professionals to devote their resources to complex tasks and strategic planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data-driven Decision Making: Incorporating AI and machine learning into cybersecurity tools facilitates a comprehensive understanding of an organization’s risk landscape, leading to informed decision-making and more accurate risk management strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automated Scanning and Patching: Constant monitoring of software and systems keeps organizations ahead of emerging threats. AI-powered solutions detect vulnerabilities, enabling timely patching and reducing windows of opportunity for malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Risk Assessment and Prioritization: AI-driven risk assessments quickly analyze factors that demand attention, enabling security teams to focus their efforts where they’re needed most, predict potential attack vectors, and model threat scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, AI-powered cybersecurity solutions are paving the way for more robust and efficient defense mechanisms against constantly evolving cyber threats. By embracing these emerging technologies in areas such as anomaly detection organizations can better protect their digital assets and maintain a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;navigating-the-digital-frontier-the-future-of-cybersecurity&quot;&gt;Navigating the Digital Frontier: The Future of Cybersecurity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats necessitates a proactive and adaptive approach to cybersecurity. While AI technologies continue to alarmingly advance the capabilities of cybercriminals, they also hold immense potential for strengthening an organization’s security posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI may not be the silver bullet for all cyber threats; a successful defense strategy requires a multi-layered approach. This encompasses the adoption of additional security tools and techniques, robust policies and governance models, and promoting a culture of cybersecurity awareness among employees. By embracing AI as part of their cybersecurity strategies, organizations can innovate and flourish in the face of challenges, securing their digital assets and maintaining a competitive edge in the Digital Arms Race.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Lightning Network - Revolutionizing Bitcoin Transactions</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;bitcoin-the-worlds-pioneering-decentralized-cryptocurrency-eliminates-the-need-for-a-central-authority-and-has-garnered-massive-global-traction-due-to-its-secure-swift-and-inexpensive-cross-border-transactions-however-with-increased-popularity-comes-significant-challenges-with-scalability-being-the-most-critical-consequently-the-lightning-network-was-born-to-address-these-issues&quot;&gt;Bitcoin, the world’s pioneering decentralized cryptocurrency, eliminates the need for a central authority and has garnered massive global traction due to its secure, swift, and inexpensive cross-border transactions. However, with increased popularity comes significant &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/bitcoin-scale/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt;, with scalability being the most critical. Consequently, the Lightning Network was born to address these issues.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lightning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lightning network logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bitcoins-scalability-dilemma&quot;&gt;Bitcoin’s Scalability Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability is a major concern for Bitcoin, stemming from its finite transaction processing capacity. The current Bitcoin network can only process about 7 transactions per second, leading to slow-processing times, increased transaction fees, and network congestion during peak demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lightning-network&quot;&gt;The Lightning Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lightning Network is an ingenious second-layer protocol built atop the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to overcome Bitcoin’s scalability challenges by enabling rapid, low-cost transactions between parties without requiring third-party intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating through a network of payment channels between users, the Lightning Network allows users to conduct off-chain transactions that don’t get recorded on the primary Bitcoin blockchain. Instead, these transactions exist within a separate layer of the Lightning Network and are only settled on the Bitcoin blockchain once the payment channel is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To leverage the Lightning Network, users must first establish a payment channel with a counterparty by opening a channel on the platform and depositing a specific amount of Bitcoin. Once the channel is open, users can instantly execute transactions with minimal fees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-the-lightning-network&quot;&gt;The Benefits of the Lightning Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lightning Network presents numerous benefits over traditional on-chain Bitcoin transactions. First and foremost, it enables instantaneous transactions between parties without necessitating third-party intervention—settling transactions within seconds, as opposed to several minutes in conventional systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Lightning Network drastically curtails transaction fees. Traditional Bitcoin transactions mandate users to pay a fee to miners for transaction processing, which can escalate during high-demand periods. However, as off-chain transactions are processed within the Lightning Network, transaction fees are considerably reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Lightning Network affords users enhanced privacy. Regular Bitcoin transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain, allowing anyone to trace fund movements between Bitcoin addresses. Conversely, the Lightning Network operates off-chain, concealing transactions from public view and providing users with greater privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lightning Network constitutes a promising solution for Bitcoin’s scalability conundrum. By facilitating fast, low-cost transactions between parties without the interference of third-party intermediaries, it holds the potential to significantly enhance the practicality and adoption of Bitcoin. As its development and adoption continue to progress, the Lightning Network may become an essential component of the ever-evolving Bitcoin ecosystem, primed to accommodate the growing needs of a burgeoning user base.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ATT&amp;CK - Threat Intelligence</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-attck-adversarial-techniques-tactics-and-common-knowledge-framework-is-an-open-source-threat-intelligence-knowledge-base-designed-to-equip-organizations-with-the-information-they-need-to-defend-their-networks-against-sophisticated-cyber-threats&quot;&gt;The ATT&amp;amp;CK (Adversarial Techniques, Tactics, and Common Knowledge) framework is an open-source threat intelligence knowledge base designed to equip organizations with the information they need to defend their networks against sophisticated cyber threats.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed by MITRE Corporation and a community of security experts and practitioners, ATT&amp;amp;CK provides a comprehensive view of attack tactics and techniques across all stages of the adversary lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MITRE-Eval-Blog-Image2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ATT&amp;amp;CK logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;/a&gt; framework to gain better visibility into the tactics, techniques, and procedures adversaries use to attack their systems. By understanding the various stages of the attacker lifecycle, organizations can build more effective security defenses and incident response plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ATT&amp;amp;CK framework can also be used to prioritize and validate detection logic. Companies can review techniques and tactics used by adversaries in past attacks and develop rules and use cases based on that information. This can help ensure that detection logic is focused on the most pressing security risks. Additionally, companies can use ATT&amp;amp;CK to better understand the tactics and techniques used by threat actors, which can help inform their security investments and plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attack-lifecycle&quot;&gt;Attack Lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATT&amp;amp;CK divides attack tactics into nine stages based on real-world observations of attackers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Access&lt;/strong&gt; covers techniques used to gain access to the target system&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution&lt;/strong&gt; describes how adversaries establish a foothold after gaining access&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence&lt;/strong&gt; relates to how attackers maintain their presence on the system&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; covers the approach used to identify assets and vulnerabilities in the system&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateral Movement&lt;/strong&gt; represents procedures used to move across the network&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collection&lt;/strong&gt; describes how attackers extract data from systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command and Control&lt;/strong&gt; relate to techniques used to control compromised systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exfiltration&lt;/strong&gt; covers techniques used to transport data out of the system&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt; describes the ultimate objectives of the attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between tactics and techniques can be visualized in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ATT&amp;amp;CK Matrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, under the tactic &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt;, there are a series of techniques including &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Active Scanning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1591/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gather Victim Org Information&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these is a single technique that attackers may use to achieve the goal of reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*DioJj9NQNtDXGBTEO_8-7w.webp&quot; alt=&quot;ATT&amp;amp;CK logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MITRE has released a great series of getting started &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mitre-attack/getting-started/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;. Organizations can use ATT&amp;amp;CK to prioritize and validate detection logic by analyzing techniques used by adversaries in past attacks. With this knowledge, organizations can start developing rules and use cases to better protect their networks against sophisticated threats.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Semgrep - Security Testing</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;static-application-security-testing-or-sast-is-a-testing-methodology-to-analyse-application-source-code-and-to-identify-security-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Static Application Security Testing or SAST is a testing methodology to analyse application source code and to identify security vulnerabilities.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many compliance frameworks require organizations to perform security testing prior to pushing code into production environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/returntocorp/semgrep/develop/semgrep.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Semgrep logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semgrep&quot;&gt;Semgrep&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Semgrep&lt;/a&gt; is a free open-source static code analysis tool developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://r2c.dev/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;r2c&lt;/a&gt; and the open-source community. It has stable support for Go, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Python, and Ruby and experimental support for many other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complement the native semgrep tool, r2c also provides a continuous integration service (called Semgrep CI) and maintains a rule library (called Semgrep Registry). Basic individual use of these services are offered for free while paid tiers cover team and commercial use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a bit confusing at the beginning but there are three ways of running semgrep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semgrep CLI&lt;/strong&gt; is the command line interface for semgrep and can be easily installed via &lt;em&gt;brew&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt; and executed in a source code directory with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;semgrep --config=auto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semgrep App&lt;/strong&gt; is esentially Semgrep CLI but can be integrated in GitHub or GiLab and now the scans are configurable in repositories via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;semgrep.yml&lt;/code&gt;. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-app/getting-started-with-semgrep-app/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;setting everything up&lt;/a&gt;, Semgrep can be executed daily or weekly or on a PR (pull request) or MR (merge request).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semgrep CI&lt;/strong&gt; is the approach where Semgrep is integrated in you CI (continuous integration) environment. When connecting it to Semgrep App you can now do things like bulk triage for false positives, notifications via Slack and email and PR/MR review comments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We suggest to start with Semgrep CLI or a plugin for your preferred IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules are at the core of a software like semgrep. These instructions describe patterns in the source code. A code finding is when the mentioned rules detect a match in the code. Semgrep matches the code using rules to report a finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semgrep support developers by catching issues of security, performance, correctness, and enforce best practices. Rules are either created by the community or can be customly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-noise&quot;&gt;Finding Noise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static analysis has a reputation for being “noisy”, reporting hundreds or even thousands of rule violations just when you thought you were ready to release. Fortunately, semgrep provides strategies for dealing with those false positives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;states&quot;&gt;States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semgrep CI can track the lifetime of an individual finding in a 4-tuple: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(rule ID, file path, syntactic context, index)&lt;/code&gt;. These are hashed and returned as the uniqye identifier of a finding aka the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;syntactic_id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semgrep App provides the most flexibility in managing findings. Here, the finding can move between states according to the unique &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;syntactic_id&lt;/code&gt; from Semgrep CI. The four states are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OPEN&lt;/code&gt;: the finding exists in the code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FIXED&lt;/code&gt;: the finding existed in the code but is no longer found&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MUTED&lt;/code&gt;: the finding has been ignored&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;REMOVED&lt;/code&gt;: the finding’s rule isn’t enabled anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shift-left&quot;&gt;Shift Left&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the application testing is executed before code is compiled into an artifact and pushed into production (testing/staging). If code doesn’t meet the quality gates, the test fails and the deployment is stopped. This gatekeeper approach causes significant bottlenecks in the development lifecycle and isn’t compatible with agile methodologies, which emphasize early feedback and development velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting the static application security testing to the left enables developers to identify and fix issues much earlier in the development lifecycle. This make the software development more efficient, improves quality, and enables faster deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semgrep can be integrated in most editors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IntelliJ&lt;/a&gt;. By doing this developers get direct feedback from semgrep while they write code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toyota-hacked---leaked-credentials&quot;&gt;Toyota Hacked - Leaked Credentials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota official connectivity app allows owners to link their smartphone with the vehicle’s infotainment system. Toyota discovered recently that a portion of the T-Connect site source code was mistakenly published on GitHub and contained an access key. This made it possible for an unauthorized third party to access the details of 296,019 customers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/toyota-discloses-data-leak-after-access-key-exposed-on-github/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;github-actions-are-being-abused-to-run-mining-operations&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions are being abused to run mining operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sysdig Threat Research Team (Sysdig TRT) recently uncovered an extensive and sophisticated active cryptomining operation in which a threat actor is using some of the largest cloud and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) service providers. The activity observed is known as “freejacking,” which is the abuse of compute allocated for free trial accounts on SaaS platforms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sysdig.com/blog/massive-cryptomining-operation-github-actions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;list-of-common-passwords-accounts-for-nearly-all-cyberattacks&quot;&gt;List of Common Passwords Accounts for Nearly All Cyberattacks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability management firm Rapid7 recorded every attempt to compromise their honeypot servers over a 12-month period, finding that the attempted credential attacks resulted in 512,000 permutations. Almost all of those passwords (99.997%) are included in a common password list - the RockYou2021 file. It seems like attackers are just taking the easy road. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/a-common-password-list-accounts-for-nearly-all-cyberattacks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Roundup September 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;this-month-multiple-hacks-have-show-that-mfa-is-becoming-a-main-target-for-attacks-in-many-organizations-authentication-processes-a-stark-reminder-to-replace-time-based-one-time-passwords-totp-with-man-in-the-middle-resistant-forms-of-mfa-like-u2f&quot;&gt;This month, multiple hacks have show that MFA is becoming a main target for attacks in many organizations’ authentication processes. A stark reminder to replace time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) with man-in-the-middle resistant forms of MFA like &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/universal-2nd-factor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U2F&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uber-hacked---mfa-weakness-i&quot;&gt;Uber Hacked - MFA Weakness I&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ride-sharing giant Uber took some of its operations offline after it discovered that its internal systems have been compromised. An attacker was able to social-engineer his way into an employee’s VPN account before moving deeper into the network. “They pretty much have full access to Uber,” Sam Curry, a security engineer at Yuga Labs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/uber-breach-external-contractor-mfa-bombing-attack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rockstar-games-hacked---mfa-weakness-ii&quot;&gt;Rockstar Games Hacked - MFA Weakness II&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video game publisher Rockstar Games released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1571849091860029455&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; revealing a network intrusion and informing fans that details about their new Grand Theft Auto game had been leaked. Reliable details of the hack are not available yet. It is rumored the attack was performed by the same threat actor that is behind the Uber breach. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/rockstar-games-confirms-grand-theft-auto-6-breach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transitioning-to-multiple-aws-accounts&quot;&gt;Transitioning to multiple AWS accounts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies struggle with applying the least-privilege principle to their existing single-account AWS environment. Justin Plock discusses transitioning from a single-account environment to a multi-account environment, including decisions you need to make about network, user management, security, access control, and architecture. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/transitioning-to-multiple-aws-accounts/welcome.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-official-says-civilian-satellites-may-be-a-legitimate-military-target&quot;&gt;Russian official says civilian satellites may be a legitimate military target&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while SpaceX’s Starlink satellite Internet has proved valuable in Ukraine, new threats are coming from Russia. Without mentioning Starlink by name, Russia’s representative at a United Nations meeting on threats from space and possible countermeasures spoke of an “extremely dangerous trend”. He was referring to the use of civilian or commercial infrastructure in space for military purposes by “the United States and its allies.” Quasi-civilian infrastructure can thus become a legitimate target for retaliation”, he said. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/russian-diplomat-suggests-attacks-on-satellites-in-possible-reference-to-starlink/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;microsoft-investigates-iranian-attacks-against-the-albanian-government&quot;&gt;Microsoft investigates Iranian attacks against the Albanian government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) has released an in-depth analysis after being engaged by the Albanian government to lead an investigation into the attacks. According to the report, Microsoft assumes that “with a high degree of probability” several Iranian actors were involved in the attack, which was carried out in several phases. Tools and a digital certificate that had previously been used by actors from Iran were seen in action against the Albanian government. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/08/microsoft-investigates-iranian-attacks-against-the-albanian-government/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;san-franciscos-subway-only-runs-thanks-to-windows-98-and-dos&quot;&gt;San Francisco’s subway only runs thanks to Windows 98 and DOS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newspaper The Mercury News reports on the 50th anniversary of the Bart (Bay Area Rapid Transport) subway and the numerous technical difficulties in keeping the old trains running. According to the report, some of the problems are due to completely outdated technology. This apparently includes Windows 98. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/09/17/how-clever-mechanics-keep-50-year-old-bart-trains-running-windows-98-ebay-and-scraps/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claimed lax security at Twitter is bad news. But one clearly captures the extent of systemic issues. Engineers had extensive access to the social network’s live, deployed software platform with minimal logging and monitoring. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/mudge-twitter-whistleblower-security/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;our-selection-of-the-best-articles-code-and-projects-we-found-this-past-month&quot;&gt;Our selection of the best articles, code, and projects we found this past month.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;consequences-of-inadequate-identity-management-in-github&quot;&gt;Consequences of Inadequate Identity Management in GitHub&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity and Access Management is a major area of concern for security teams, including source control management like GitHub. The blog article raises three major risks people should be aware of. In addition, we suggest taking a good look at the CI/CD system and the service accounts controlling production environments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cidersecurity.io/blog/research/the-consequences-of-inadequate-identity-management-in-your-github-organization/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-a-product-security-program&quot;&gt;Building A Product Security Program&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anshuman Bhartiya writes on his blog about the different aspects of building a product security program from scratch. He writes about the essential topics of risk appetite, prioritization, relationships, and empathy. This article is a great start for anyone who has to implement a secure development approach in an organization. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anshumanbhartiya.com/posts/building-product-security-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-a-headstart-on-post-quantum-cryptography&quot;&gt;Get A Headstart On Post-Quantum Cryptography&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography describes the fact practically all data sent over the Internet today is at risk in the future if a stable quantum computer is created. Cloudflare has released open-source software and experimental services to test post-quantum key agreements. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/experiment-with-pq/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cisco-data-breach&quot;&gt;Cisco Data Breach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cisco has confirmed a breach of its network, the attacker used voice phishing to convince an employee to accept a malicious multifactor authentication (MFA). With access established, the attacker then moved through the network by escalating privileges and logging into multiple systems. Cisco believes the threat actor is an initial access broker - an adversary that gains unauthorized access to networks and then sells that access on the Dark Web. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/cisco-confirms-data-breach-hacked-files-leaked&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cisco Talos did a great write-up with all the details related to the cyber attack. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/08/recent-cyber-attack.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lastpass-data-breach&quot;&gt;LastPass Data Breach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattackers have compromised the internal systems of the password management company LastPass, stealing source code and intellectual property. LastPass said it detected anomalous activity in its development environment. After a forensic investigation, it was determined that the attacker compromised a developer account to gain access to the network, taking intellectual property from the company. The adversaries weren’t able to access customer data or encrypted password vaults according to LastPass. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lastpass-developer-systems-hacked-to-steal-source-code/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;record-ddos-layer7-attack&quot;&gt;Record DDoS Layer7 Attack&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google reports a new record for DDoS on Layer 7: The Mēris botnet is believed to have sent a total of up to 46 million requests for HTTPS connections per second to the Google Cloud from 132 countries. The company compares the flood of data packets with all Wikipedia calls in an entire day, concentrated into ten seconds. According to its information, Google was able to fend off the attack. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-google-cloud-blocked-largest-layer-7-ddos-attack-at-46-million-rps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prioritize-vulnerability-management-with-ml&quot;&gt;Prioritize Vulnerability Management With ML&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a little suspicious of marketing fluff whenever we see machine learning and security mentioned in the same sentence, but researchers have now created a model for predicting which vulnerabilities will likely result in a functional exploit, an interesting tool for prioritizing patches and estimating risk. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/security-bugs-exploited-model-machine-learning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ssh-commit-verification-on-github&quot;&gt;SSH Commit Verification On GitHub&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest service provider for git repositories is now supporting commit verification with self-generated SSH keys. While GPG keys have been supported for a long time, we are now able to use SSH to give others confidence about the origin of a change. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-23-ssh-commit-verification-now-supported/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cloud-isolation-problem-postgresql&quot;&gt;Cloud Isolation Problem: PostgreSQL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tenant separation is a fundamental premise of the cloud and is at the core of trusting your cloud provider. The team of Wiz Research examined how effectively the environments of customers are isolated from each other across different cloud service providers and discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL offerings of major cloud providers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiz.io/blog/the-cloud-has-an-isolation-problem-postgresql-vulnerabilities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;massive-data-breach-in-china&quot;&gt;Massive Data Breach in China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personally identifiable information (PII) of one billion people in China has been put up for sale on the darknet. The dataset was reportedly extracted from an unsecured Shanghai police database hosted on Alibaba’s cloud hosting platform. There have been countless instances where organizations have similarly exposed sensitive data by leaving it poorly secured. What makes the Shanghai breach notable is its sheer scale. By most accounts, it is one of the largest ever known compromises of PII. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/questions-massive-shanghai-police-data-breach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solid guide to a multitude of threat modeling methodologies has been published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shellsharks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shellsharks&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the methods comes with a solid description and visualizations.

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms&quot;&gt;NIST Announces First Four Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security experts have warned that practical quantum computers could break many of today’s popular encryption algorithms, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography. On July 5, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the selection of four candidates to form the basis of future data-protection technologies able to withstand attacks from quantum computers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;most-of-the-domains-in-australia-have-security-issue-with-their-spf-and-dmarc-configuration&quot;&gt;Most Of The Domains in Australia Have Security Issue With Their SPF And DMARC Configuration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-salla/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sebastian Salla&lt;/a&gt; scanned 1.7 million Australian domains and checked for various types of SPF &amp;amp; DMARC-related issues. His interesting writeup describes how he ran 400 concurrent lambda functions for 24 hours and reveals the less than optimal results from his scan. &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniphish.com/phishing-resources/blog/australian-spf-scan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unlock-honda-cars-remotely&quot;&gt;Unlock Honda cars remotely&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of security researchers found that several modern Honda car models have a vulnerable rolling code mechanism that allows unlocking the cars or even starting the engine remotely. Called Rolling-PWN, the weakness enables replay attacks where a threat actor intercepts the codes from the keyfob to the car and uses them to unlock or start the vehicle. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-unlock-honda-cars-remotely-in-rolling-pwn-attacks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;time-to-patch-before-scan-15-minutes&quot;&gt;Time To Patch Before Scan: 15 Minutes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is less time to patch disclosed security vulnerabilities than previously thought, as a new report from Palo Alto’s Unit 42 shows. Threat actors scan for vulnerable endpoints within 15 minutes of a new CVE being publicly disclosed. The speed at which actors target devices and systems only adds additional pressure on security teams that already struggle to get vulnerabilities managed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-scan-for-vulnerabilities-within-15-minutes-of-disclosure/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;consider-attackability-for-vulnerability-management&quot;&gt;Consider “Attackability” for Vulnerability Management&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As vulnerability-management workloads surge in the face of heightened software supply chain security risks, a study reports only 3% of flaws can actually be exploited. The study also explores how to find and fix the critical 3%. It is suggested to execute a simplified threat analysis for open-source vulnerabilities resulting in a “attackability” and “reachability” score. While seeking a prioritization model like this is nothing new, the article provides a great perspective. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/open-source-software-bugs--attackability&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software-as-a-service (SaaS) application security is often a blind spot, so give your SaaS ecosystem some extra attention with the suggested 7 basic steps. SaaS is ubiquitous, highly configurable, and continuously updated, leaving many organizations vulnerable if they aren’t closely monitoring for security gaps and changes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/7-steps-to-stronger-saas-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cloud Security Toolkit</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;technologies-such-as-kubernetes-and-terraform-have-revolutionized-the-way-how-scalable-applications-are-deployed-by-using-cloud-native-tools-companies-can-focus-on-implementing-the-business-logic-of-their-applications-rather-than-having-to-maintain-a-dedicated-it-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Technologies such as Kubernetes and Terraform have revolutionized the way how scalable applications are deployed. By using cloud-native tools, companies can focus on implementing the business logic of their applications rather than having to maintain a dedicated IT infrastructure.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such environments, cloud security requires special attention - but it must also keep pace with technological advancements. What are the right priorities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/03/25/01/49/abstract-1278060_960_720.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CVSS logo&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shared-responsibility-model&quot;&gt;Shared Responsibility Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a misconception that cloud applications are more secure out of the box because the provider takes care of security. Security in the cloud remains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-risk-and-compliance/shared-responsibility-model.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shared responsibility&lt;/a&gt; between the user and the provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the shared responsibility model, the cloud provider is responsible, among other things, for the physical security of the hardware or the up-to-dateness of the drivers, for the underlying operating system, the runtime environments, and the physical protection of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud users, however, remain responsible for application security and the correct configuration of the cloud environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User overall responsibility varies from 8 to 52 percent, as estimated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ory_51733/serverless-and-the-evolution-in-cloud-security-how-faas-differs-from-iaas-4ea8bc7b1dff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ory Segal&lt;/a&gt;. In the following sections, we will outline best practices and tools that specifically apply to the responsibilities of cloud customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-security-with-sca&quot;&gt;Application Security with SCA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software Composition Analysis (SCA) examines which third-party libraries are contained in an application. This is necessary to detect existing security vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries, better known as &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/cve-system/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an analysis of the software composition also examines the application environment. For example, it looks at which applications and shared libraries are installed in a virtual machine or Docker container and whether they contain known security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCA has become an inevitable tool for enforcing application security. This is mainly due to the fact that software nowadays makes extensive use of existing code in the form of libraries instead of reinventing the wheel for each project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-security-with-sast&quot;&gt;Application Security with SAST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is essential in any well-structured Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It examines the source code of applications to identify security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many commercial and free tools exist on the market for performing static code analyses. Some can be integrated as plug-ins directly into the developer’s integrated development environment (IDE) so that developers already receive early feedback on potential security vulnerabilities. This “shift left” approach prevents surprises during the build and deployment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-configuration-security-with-ciem&quot;&gt;Cloud Configuration Security with CIEM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access management is an essential security topic and is used to manage access to services and resources. In addition to the individual cloud resources such as databases, virtual machines, containers, functions, and S3 buckets that communicate with each other, it is also necessary to tightly manage user accounts in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management (CIEM) is the right tool for this and provides a graphical representation of the access permissions within the cloud. From an organizational perspective, CIEM allows the access permissions to be kept to a minimum in line with the Principle of Least Privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-configuration-security-with-cspm&quot;&gt;Cloud Configuration Security with CSPM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tool finds misconfigurations within a cloud account. It checks all resources for conformity with common rule sets such as the Service Organization Control 2 (SOC2), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), or the benchmarks of the Center of Internet Security (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common rules in the benchmarks include typical errors such as open ports for SSH, missing data encryption in transit or at rest, or publicly exposed resources such as S3 buckets and databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;context-and-prioritization&quot;&gt;Context and Prioritization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mentioned tools are essential to secure cloud environments. Errors in the cloud setup or vulnerabilities in the application can easily open a door for attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, security teams would close all vulnerabilities as soon as they appear - but the reality is more complex. DevOps and Security teams are often understaffed in terms of personnel and available resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams need to focus on the most critical issues to keep up with the large number of alerts from various tools. Often, the severity assigned to vulnerabilities automatically define the priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But judging solely based on severity can easily lead to misjudgment. For example, an affected database server could be an unused test instance that cannot be reached from the internet and doesn’t have any critical data on it. The priority of such a vulnerable database would be low despite a high severity of a finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security teams have to be cautious when prioritizing mitigation activities and can’t exclusively rely on severity scores. The full picture (context) of the application and environment is necessary to accurately assess the risk of a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
