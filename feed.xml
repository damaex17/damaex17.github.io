        <title>AI Is Here. Security Can't Wait! Are You Ready?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://inversegravity.net/assets/images/AIshake.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shaking hands with a robot&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) isn’t just hype – it’s a fundamental shift. From automating routine tasks to uncovering hidden opportunities, AI tools are quickly becoming essential for businesses looking to boost productivity and stay competitive. Waiting for the dust to settle simply isn’t an option; the opportunities are too massive to ignore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the critical point: bringing new AI tools into your business isn’t like introducing just any new software. It comes with a unique set of security challenges that can be far more complex than anything you’ve dealt with before. As someone who’s helped companies navigate complex tech transitions, I’ve seen firsthand where the pitfalls lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down the key areas you need to focus on to embrace AI safely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;guard-your-data-what-are-you-feeding-the-ai&quot;&gt;Guard Your Data: What Are You Feeding the AI?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re entrusting a new employee with your most sensitive company secrets. That’s essentially what you’re doing when you give an AI tool access to your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI tools, especially those that process information, need data to work. But if you’re not careful, sensitive business plans, customer details, or proprietary ideas could end up where they shouldn’t. It’s like accidentally leaving your safe open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Document Everything: Clearly document what kind of data each AI tool is allowed to see and process. No surprises!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Need-to-Know Basis: Ensure people can’t use an AI tool to get information they wouldn’t normally have access to. If someone typically can’t see the company’s financial statements, an AI tool shouldn’t suddenly grant them that backdoor access.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Limit External Connections: Be very careful about AI models accessing outside data sources. Unintended connections can lead to sensitive company information leaking out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strict Access for Models: Even the AI model itself should only have access to the bare minimum data it needs to do its job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ai-supply-chain-know-your-partners&quot;&gt;The AI Supply Chain: Know Your Partners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like any other software or service you bring into your company, AI tools come from vendors. And just like any vendor, you need to do your homework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many AI tools learn from the data they process. This can be great for improving the tool, but disastrous if that data includes your confidential health records, financial data, or unique business strategies. You need to know if your data is being used to train their models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vet Your Vendors: Treat AI tool providers like any other critical supplier. This includes both paid and free tools. Assess their security practices, their data handling, and their reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the Small Print: Dive deep into the Terms and Conditions. Do they claim the right to use your input data to further train their AI model? For sensitive information (like health data, financial reports) or intellectual property (like new product designs), this is usually a deal-breaker. If your data helps train their model, it’s no longer just your data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand Data Retention: How long do they keep your data? How is it deleted? These are crucial questions for compliance and privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-in-the-loop-verify-before-you-trust&quot;&gt;Human in the Loop: Verify Before You Trust&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) are amazing at generating content, but what happens if that content is flawed or, worse, leads to unintended actions? Some AI systems can call other functions or interact with external systems. This “agency” or ability to take action requires careful oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An LLM might generate code, instructions, or even links based on a simple prompt. If you don’t properly check, clean up, and control that output before it’s used by other systems, it’s like letting an unverified stranger write instructions for your critical machinery. This could potentially allow users to indirectly access or control functions they shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an AI model suggests using an insecure or even non-existent code library, or provides incorrect legal or financial advice, trusting it without verification can introduce serious vulnerabilities, reputational damage, or even legal liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Validate Everything: Never blindly trust AI-generated output, especially if it’s going to be used by other parts of your system or by people making important decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sanitize and Filter: Treat AI output like any other user input. Clean it up, remove anything suspicious, and ensure it won’t cause problems downstream. This is like checking for dangerous ingredients before baking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define Clear Boundaries: Understand how the AI’s output might affect other systems. Make sure it can’t create a ripple effect that leads to security flaws or unauthorized actions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always Verify AI-Generated Facts: Especially for critical information, code, or advice, cross-reference AI output with trusted, external sources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Require User Approval: For any high-impact actions that an AI tool might suggest (e.g., “Delete these 100 documents”), always require a human user to confirm the action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;educating-your-team-smart-interaction-with-ai&quot;&gt;Educating Your Team: Smart Interaction with AI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your employees are your greatest asset, and that includes how they interact with new AI tools. Knowledge is your first line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without proper guidance, employees might unknowingly feed sensitive company data into public AI models, or misinterpret AI outputs, leading to security breaches or bad decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No Sensitive Input: Provide clear guidance and training on never entering sensitive company information (customer data, internal strategies, unreleased product details) into general-purpose AI tools, especially public ones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Practices for Interaction: Train your team on how to formulate secure prompts, how to verify AI outputs, and what the acceptable use of AI tools is within your company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear Policies: Update your company’s policies to specifically address AI tool usage, data retention, and acceptable deletion practices. Make sure everyone understands these rules.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continuous Awareness: Keep the conversation going. Regular reminders and tips can help keep security top of mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;innovate-confidently&quot;&gt;Innovate Confidently&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing AI into your business is not just an opportunity; it’s becoming a necessity. But it doesn’t have to be a leap of faith into the unknown. By proactively addressing critical security considerations – from data handling and supply chain vetting to intelligent output management and human oversight – you can harness the incredible power of AI to drive productivity and innovation, securely and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Steps to Secure Your AWS Environment for Regulated Businesses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running your platform on AWS gives you amazing speed and flexibility. But if you’re in a regulated industry – think finance, healthcare, or any sector dealing with sensitive customer data – keeping things secure isn’t just a good idea, it’s a must. And it can feel like a big challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spent years building and securing systems for cloud-first banks and other regulated companies, I know the challenges firsthand. The good news? You can absolutely build a strong, compliant AWS environment without slowing down your business. It’s about building security in, not bolting it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 5 clear steps to help your medium-sized business secure its AWS environment for regulated operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-smart-about-who-can-access-what-identity-and-access-management---iam&quot;&gt;Get Smart About Who Can Access What (Identity and Access Management - IAM)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the foundation of your security. Think of it like giving out keys to your house – you wouldn’t give everyone the master key. In AWS, this means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only Give Necessary Access: Make sure each person and every automated process only has the exact permissions they need to do their job, nothing more. This is called “least privilege.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Strong Authentication (MFA): Everyone, especially those with important access, should use multi-factor authentication (MFA). That’s like needing both a key and a code to get in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Centralize Control: If you have many AWS accounts, use something like AWS Identity Center to manage everyone’s access from one place. This makes life easier and more secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lock-down-your-data-encryption-and-control&quot;&gt;Lock Down Your Data (Encryption and Control)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your data is your most valuable asset, especially if it’s sensitive customer information. Regulators demand you protect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encrypt Everything: Make sure all your data is encrypted both when it’s stored away (like in an S3 bucket or database) and when it’s moving around between systems. AWS has easy ways to do this using services like KMS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Know Your Data: Understand what kind of data you have (e.g., public, internal, highly confidential). This helps you decide how much effort you invest to protect it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guard Your Secrets: Don’t just put passwords and sensitive keys directly into your code. Use AWS Secrets Manager to store them safely and retrieve them securely when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-security-around-your-network-network-security&quot;&gt;Build Security Around Your Network (Network Security)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure only authorized traffic gets in and out, and that different parts of your environment are separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Divide and Conquer (VPCs and Subnets): Use Amazon VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) to create isolated sections for different parts of your business (e.g., customer-facing apps in one area, internal data processing in another).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control the Gates (Security Groups &amp;amp; NACLs): These are like firewalls that decide what network traffic is allowed. Be very specific about who can talk to whom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protect Your Public Applications (WAF): If you have web applications, put an WAF (Web Application Firewall) in front of them. This protects you from common web attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-a-constant-eye-on-things-monitoring-and-incident-response&quot;&gt;Keep a Constant Eye on Things (Monitoring and Incident Response)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to know what’s happening in your AWS environment all the time, so you can spot problems early and act fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Log Everything That Matters: Collect all the important logs from your AWS services (like CloudTrail for user actions, VPC Flow Logs for network traffic). Store them securely so you have a clear record.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detect Threats Smartly: Use tools like AWS GuardDuty that use intelligence to automatically look for suspicious activity in your accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check Your Setup Regularly: Use AWS Security Hub and AWS Config to constantly check if your AWS settings follow security best practices and compliance rules.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a Plan: Even with all the best defenses, things can go wrong. Have a clear incident response plan for what to do if a security event happens – who does what, when, and how.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-security-into-everything-you-do-secure-development--automation&quot;&gt;Build Security Into Everything You Do (Secure Development &amp;amp; Automation)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security isn’t just for after you’ve built something. It needs to be part of the whole process, from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security from the Start (SSDLC): Make security a core part of how you design, build, and deploy your software. This is called a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automate Security Checks: Use tools to automatically check your code for security flaws as you write it. This “shifts left” security, catching issues early.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code Your Infrastructure Securely: Instead of manually setting up AWS services, use “Infrastructure as Code” tools like Terraform or CloudFormation. This makes your setup consistent, repeatable, and easier to secure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Train Your Teams: Regularly train your developers and operations teams on security best practices. Help them understand their role in keeping things safe. Build a human firewall!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;onwards&quot;&gt;Onwards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing your AWS environment for regulated businesses isn’t a one-time project; it’s an ongoing journey. By following these steps and focusing on building security into your processes, you can protect your business, meet regulatory demands, and continue to innovate with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Self-Signed Certificates</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption remains a cornerstone for safeguarding sensitive information. While commercial Certificate Authorities (CAs) provide trusted SSL certificates for public-facing services, a self-signed Certificate can be a practical and cost-effective solution for internal network communications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although modern browsers typically reject self-signed certificates due to trust issues, these certificates are valuable for encrypting internal traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating your own self-signed certificate and using it to sign Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), you can secure data transmission across your internal networks or implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for client and server authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we explore the process of setting up a self-signed certificate and demonstrate how to sign CSRs, highlighting the benefits of this strategy for internal security resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/key.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture of a key&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-private-key&quot;&gt;Create Private Key&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private key serves as the foundational element for creating a self-signed certificate because it is at the core of the cryptographic operations that underpin certificate signing and validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out CA.key 4096
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we use OpenSSL to generate a secure 4096-bit &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/public-key/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asymmetric&lt;/a&gt;
RSA private key and secure it with the &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/crypto-symmetric/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;symmetric&lt;/a&gt; AES algorithm. Other options for algorithms and key length can be found in the manpage of OpenSSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenSSL will ask for a passphrase. Protecting the private key is essential, as any compromise could allow malicious actors to issue fraudulent certificates, undermining trust and security within your internal environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-the-self-signed-root-certificate&quot;&gt;Create the Self-Signed Root Certificate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now proceed to create our self-signed root certificate using the private key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key CA.key -sha256 -days 1826 -out CA.crt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we use the sha256 &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/crypto-hash-digital-signature/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hashing algorithms&lt;/a&gt; and set the certificate’s validity to 1826 days or roughly 5 years. As always, alternative options are available in the man page of OpenSSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be asked to enter the passphrase for the private key you selected, as well as to answer several questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enter pass phrase for CA.key:
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:DE
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Bavaria
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Munich
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:inversegravity    
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:InfoSec
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:inversegravity
Email Address []:inversegravity.net@gmail.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the responses to these questions are not particularly critical, they do appear when viewing the certificate, a task you will seldom need to do. For the Common Name, I recommend choosing something easily identifiable as your root certificate among other certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the self-signed Root Certificate, our internal “CA” is now operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-certificate-signing-request-csr&quot;&gt;Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s generate our Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for our first certificate, which could be used to secure internal network traffic. This process mirrors what customers typically submit to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) for signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout CSR.key -out CSR.csr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike with our root certificate, where the key was generated separately, we create the private key alongside the CSR and use the RSA algorithm with a shorter key length of 2048 bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also employ the -nodes option to leave the private key unencrypted, avoiding the need to enter a password when restarting the service utilizing the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we omit the x509 argument to signal to OpenSSL that we are creating a CSR instead of a self-signed certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;..+................+............+..+.......+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++......
+++..........+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++........+++++++++++++++++++...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++......+++++++++..........+

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:DE
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Bavaria
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Munich
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:inversegravity
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:InfoSec
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:nas.internal.inversegravity.net
Email Address []:inversegravity.net@gmail.com

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dots (.) and plus signs (+) you see provide a visual indication that the process of generating randomness required for key creation is underway, ensuring that the key is as secure as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The password from the ‘extra’ attributes is not used to encrypt the CSR. It’s only used by some trusted CAs for certificate revocation. The optional company name can be omitted as well for our use-case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sign-the-csr&quot;&gt;Sign the CSR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to sign the CSR with our self-signed root certificate. We essentially act as your own CA in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in CSRcsr -CA CA.crt -CAkey CA.key -out CSR.crt 
-set_serial 01 -sha256
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=C = DE, ST = Bavaria, L = Munich, O = inversegravity, OU = security, 
CN = nas.internal.inversegravity.net, emailAddress = inversegravity@gmail.com
Enter pass phrase for CA.key:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to enter the password of the private key of the self-signed root certificate to sign the CSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;certificate-usage&quot;&gt;Certificate Usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having generated a certificate, we can leverage it in various software development scenarios and internal network applications. However, it’s important to remember that web browsers do not inherently trust this certificate, as they typically require validation from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to establish authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few practical use cases where your certificate can be applied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VPN Authentication: Certificates can be used to authenticate clients and servers within virtual private networks (VPNs). This ensures that only authorized users and devices can access the network, enhancing security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS): In mTLS, both the client and server authenticate each other using certificates. This bidirectional authentication process adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that both parties are verified before communication is established.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transport Layer Security (TLS): TLS is used to encrypt data transmitted over networks, securing communication between clients and servers. By using your certificate, you can facilitate encrypted connections within internal applications or systems, protecting sensitive data from interception and tampering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;certificate-confusion&quot;&gt;Certificate Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we started by creating a self-signed root certificate, which, while not inherently trusted on the open internet, can serve as a trusted entity within our internal environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using this root certificate, we’ve signed a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to generate a “service” certificate. This certificate can be effectively used to secure an internal web server or protect our internal network, improving our security posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these service certificates are not automatically trusted by standard web browsers, they can be manually added for our internal services, ensuring smooth operations and heightened security within our controlled environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing self-signed certificates provides flexibility and control, allowing you to manage secure communications without the need for third-party Certificate Authorities (CAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                +------------------+
                                | Root Certificate |
                                |    Self-Signed   |
                                +------------------+
                                          |
                                +---------+--------+
                                |                  |
                         +-------------+    +-------------+
                         | Certificate |    | Certificate |
                         +-------------+    +-------------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-try-self-signed-certificates&quot;&gt;Why Try Self-Signed Certificates?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost-Effective Security: You can enhance security without incurring the cost of purchasing certificates from external CAs, making it an economical choice for development and internal applications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Lightning Network - Revolutionizing Bitcoin Transactions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin, the world’s pioneering decentralized cryptocurrency, eliminates the need for a central authority and has garnered massive global traction due to its secure, swift, and inexpensive cross-border transactions. However, with increased popularity comes significant &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/bitcoin-scale/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt;, with scalability being the most critical. Consequently, the Lightning Network was born to address these issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lightning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lightning network logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bitcoins-scalability-dilemma&quot;&gt;Bitcoin’s Scalability Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability is a major concern for Bitcoin, stemming from its finite transaction processing capacity. The current Bitcoin network can only process about 7 transactions per second, leading to slow-processing times, increased transaction fees, and network congestion during peak demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lightning-network&quot;&gt;The Lightning Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lightning Network is an ingenious second-layer protocol built atop the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to overcome Bitcoin’s scalability challenges by enabling rapid, low-cost transactions between parties without requiring third-party intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating through a network of payment channels between users, the Lightning Network allows users to conduct off-chain transactions that don’t get recorded on the primary Bitcoin blockchain. Instead, these transactions exist within a separate layer of the Lightning Network and are only settled on the Bitcoin blockchain once the payment channel is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To leverage the Lightning Network, users must first establish a payment channel with a counterparty by opening a channel on the platform and depositing a specific amount of Bitcoin. Once the channel is open, users can instantly execute transactions with minimal fees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-the-lightning-network&quot;&gt;The Benefits of the Lightning Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lightning Network presents numerous benefits over traditional on-chain Bitcoin transactions. First and foremost, it enables instantaneous transactions between parties without necessitating third-party intervention—settling transactions within seconds, as opposed to several minutes in conventional systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Lightning Network drastically curtails transaction fees. Traditional Bitcoin transactions mandate users to pay a fee to miners for transaction processing, which can escalate during high-demand periods. However, as off-chain transactions are processed within the Lightning Network, transaction fees are considerably reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Lightning Network affords users enhanced privacy. Regular Bitcoin transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain, allowing anyone to trace fund movements between Bitcoin addresses. Conversely, the Lightning Network operates off-chain, concealing transactions from public view and providing users with greater privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lightning Network constitutes a promising solution for Bitcoin’s scalability conundrum. By facilitating fast, low-cost transactions between parties without the interference of third-party intermediaries, it holds the potential to significantly enhance the practicality and adoption of Bitcoin. As its development and adoption continue to progress, the Lightning Network may become an essential component of the ever-evolving Bitcoin ecosystem, primed to accommodate the growing needs of a burgeoning user base.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ATT&amp;CK - Threat Intelligence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ATT&amp;amp;CK (Adversarial Techniques, Tactics, and Common Knowledge) framework is an open-source threat intelligence knowledge base designed to equip organizations with the information they need to defend their networks against sophisticated cyber threats.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed by MITRE Corporation and a community of security experts and practitioners, ATT&amp;amp;CK provides a comprehensive view of attack tactics and techniques across all stages of the adversary lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MITRE-Eval-Blog-Image2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ATT&amp;amp;CK logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;/a&gt; framework to gain better visibility into the tactics, techniques, and procedures adversaries use to attack their systems. By understanding the various stages of the attacker lifecycle, organizations can build more effective security defenses and incident response plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ATT&amp;amp;CK framework can also be used to prioritize and validate detection logic. Companies can review techniques and tactics used by adversaries in past attacks and develop rules and use cases based on that information. This can help ensure that detection logic is focused on the most pressing security risks. Additionally, companies can use ATT&amp;amp;CK to better understand the tactics and techniques used by threat actors, which can help inform their security investments and plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attack-lifecycle&quot;&gt;Attack Lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATT&amp;amp;CK divides attack tactics into nine stages based on real-world observations of attackers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Access&lt;/strong&gt; covers techniques used to gain access to the target system&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution&lt;/strong&gt; describes how adversaries establish a foothold after gaining access&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence&lt;/strong&gt; relates to how attackers maintain their presence on the system&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; covers the approach used to identify assets and vulnerabilities in the system&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateral Movement&lt;/strong&gt; represents procedures used to move across the network&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collection&lt;/strong&gt; describes how attackers extract data from systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command and Control&lt;/strong&gt; relate to techniques used to control compromised systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exfiltration&lt;/strong&gt; covers techniques used to transport data out of the system&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt; describes the ultimate objectives of the attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between tactics and techniques can be visualized in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ATT&amp;amp;CK Matrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, under the tactic &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt;, there are a series of techniques including &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Active Scanning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1591/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gather Victim Org Information&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these is a single technique that attackers may use to achieve the goal of reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*DioJj9NQNtDXGBTEO_8-7w.webp&quot; alt=&quot;ATT&amp;amp;CK logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MITRE has released a great series of getting started &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mitre-attack/getting-started/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;. Organizations can use ATT&amp;amp;CK to prioritize and validate detection logic by analyzing techniques used by adversaries in past attacks. With this knowledge, organizations can start developing rules and use cases to better protect their networks against sophisticated threats.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Semgrep - Security Testing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static Application Security Testing or SAST is a testing methodology to analyse application source code and to identify security vulnerabilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many compliance frameworks require organizations to perform security testing prior to pushing code into production environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/returntocorp/semgrep/develop/semgrep.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Semgrep logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semgrep&quot;&gt;Semgrep&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Semgrep&lt;/a&gt; is a free open-source static code analysis tool developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://r2c.dev/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;r2c&lt;/a&gt; and the open-source community. It has stable support for Go, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Python, and Ruby and experimental support for many other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complement the native semgrep tool, r2c also provides a continuous integration service (called Semgrep CI) and maintains a rule library (called Semgrep Registry). Basic individual use of these services are offered for free while paid tiers cover team and commercial use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a bit confusing at the beginning but there are three ways of running semgrep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semgrep CLI&lt;/strong&gt; is the command line interface for semgrep and can be easily installed via &lt;em&gt;brew&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt; and executed in a source code directory with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;semgrep --config=auto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semgrep App&lt;/strong&gt; is esentially Semgrep CLI but can be integrated in GitHub or GiLab and now the scans are configurable in repositories via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;semgrep.yml&lt;/code&gt;. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-app/getting-started-with-semgrep-app/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;setting everything up&lt;/a&gt;, Semgrep can be executed daily or weekly or on a PR (pull request) or MR (merge request).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semgrep CI&lt;/strong&gt; is the approach where Semgrep is integrated in you CI (continuous integration) environment. When connecting it to Semgrep App you can now do things like bulk triage for false positives, notifications via Slack and email and PR/MR review comments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We suggest to start with Semgrep CLI or a plugin for your preferred IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules are at the core of a software like semgrep. These instructions describe patterns in the source code. A code finding is when the mentioned rules detect a match in the code. Semgrep matches the code using rules to report a finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semgrep support developers by catching issues of security, performance, correctness, and enforce best practices. Rules are either created by the community or can be customly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-noise&quot;&gt;Finding Noise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static analysis has a reputation for being “noisy”, reporting hundreds or even thousands of rule violations just when you thought you were ready to release. Fortunately, semgrep provides strategies for dealing with those false positives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;states&quot;&gt;States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semgrep CI can track the lifetime of an individual finding in a 4-tuple: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(rule ID, file path, syntactic context, index)&lt;/code&gt;. These are hashed and returned as the uniqye identifier of a finding aka the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;syntactic_id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semgrep App provides the most flexibility in managing findings. Here, the finding can move between states according to the unique &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;syntactic_id&lt;/code&gt; from Semgrep CI. The four states are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OPEN&lt;/code&gt;: the finding exists in the code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FIXED&lt;/code&gt;: the finding existed in the code but is no longer found&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MUTED&lt;/code&gt;: the finding has been ignored&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;REMOVED&lt;/code&gt;: the finding’s rule isn’t enabled anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shift-left&quot;&gt;Shift Left&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the application testing is executed before code is compiled into an artifact and pushed into production (testing/staging). If code doesn’t meet the quality gates, the test fails and the deployment is stopped. This gatekeeper approach causes significant bottlenecks in the development lifecycle and isn’t compatible with agile methodologies, which emphasize early feedback and development velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting the static application security testing to the left enables developers to identify and fix issues much earlier in the development lifecycle. This make the software development more efficient, improves quality, and enables faster deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semgrep can be integrated in most editors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IntelliJ&lt;/a&gt;. By doing this developers get direct feedback from semgrep while they write code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toyota-hacked---leaked-credentials&quot;&gt;Toyota Hacked - Leaked Credentials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota official connectivity app allows owners to link their smartphone with the vehicle’s infotainment system. Toyota discovered recently that a portion of the T-Connect site source code was mistakenly published on GitHub and contained an access key. This made it possible for an unauthorized third party to access the details of 296,019 customers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/toyota-discloses-data-leak-after-access-key-exposed-on-github/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;github-actions-are-being-abused-to-run-mining-operations&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions are being abused to run mining operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sysdig Threat Research Team (Sysdig TRT) recently uncovered an extensive and sophisticated active cryptomining operation in which a threat actor is using some of the largest cloud and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) service providers. The activity observed is known as “freejacking,” which is the abuse of compute allocated for free trial accounts on SaaS platforms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sysdig.com/blog/massive-cryptomining-operation-github-actions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;list-of-common-passwords-accounts-for-nearly-all-cyberattacks&quot;&gt;List of Common Passwords Accounts for Nearly All Cyberattacks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability management firm Rapid7 recorded every attempt to compromise their honeypot servers over a 12-month period, finding that the attempted credential attacks resulted in 512,000 permutations. Almost all of those passwords (99.997%) are included in a common password list - the RockYou2021 file. It seems like attackers are just taking the easy road. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/a-common-password-list-accounts-for-nearly-all-cyberattacks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Roundup September 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This month, multiple hacks have show that MFA is becoming a main target for attacks in many organizations’ authentication processes. A stark reminder to replace time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) with man-in-the-middle resistant forms of MFA like &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/universal-2nd-factor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U2F&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uber-hacked---mfa-weakness-i&quot;&gt;Uber Hacked - MFA Weakness I&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ride-sharing giant Uber took some of its operations offline after it discovered that its internal systems have been compromised. An attacker was able to social-engineer his way into an employee’s VPN account before moving deeper into the network. “They pretty much have full access to Uber,” Sam Curry, a security engineer at Yuga Labs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/uber-breach-external-contractor-mfa-bombing-attack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rockstar-games-hacked---mfa-weakness-ii&quot;&gt;Rockstar Games Hacked - MFA Weakness II&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video game publisher Rockstar Games released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1571849091860029455&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; revealing a network intrusion and informing fans that details about their new Grand Theft Auto game had been leaked. Reliable details of the hack are not available yet. It is rumored the attack was performed by the same threat actor that is behind the Uber breach. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/rockstar-games-confirms-grand-theft-auto-6-breach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transitioning-to-multiple-aws-accounts&quot;&gt;Transitioning to multiple AWS accounts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies struggle with applying the least-privilege principle to their existing single-account AWS environment. Justin Plock discusses transitioning from a single-account environment to a multi-account environment, including decisions you need to make about network, user management, security, access control, and architecture. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/transitioning-to-multiple-aws-accounts/welcome.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-official-says-civilian-satellites-may-be-a-legitimate-military-target&quot;&gt;Russian official says civilian satellites may be a legitimate military target&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while SpaceX’s Starlink satellite Internet has proved valuable in Ukraine, new threats are coming from Russia. Without mentioning Starlink by name, Russia’s representative at a United Nations meeting on threats from space and possible countermeasures spoke of an “extremely dangerous trend”. He was referring to the use of civilian or commercial infrastructure in space for military purposes by “the United States and its allies.” Quasi-civilian infrastructure can thus become a legitimate target for retaliation”, he said. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/russian-diplomat-suggests-attacks-on-satellites-in-possible-reference-to-starlink/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;microsoft-investigates-iranian-attacks-against-the-albanian-government&quot;&gt;Microsoft investigates Iranian attacks against the Albanian government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) has released an in-depth analysis after being engaged by the Albanian government to lead an investigation into the attacks. According to the report, Microsoft assumes that “with a high degree of probability” several Iranian actors were involved in the attack, which was carried out in several phases. Tools and a digital certificate that had previously been used by actors from Iran were seen in action against the Albanian government. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/08/microsoft-investigates-iranian-attacks-against-the-albanian-government/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;san-franciscos-subway-only-runs-thanks-to-windows-98-and-dos&quot;&gt;San Francisco’s subway only runs thanks to Windows 98 and DOS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newspaper The Mercury News reports on the 50th anniversary of the Bart (Bay Area Rapid Transport) subway and the numerous technical difficulties in keeping the old trains running. According to the report, some of the problems are due to completely outdated technology. This apparently includes Windows 98. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/09/17/how-clever-mechanics-keep-50-year-old-bart-trains-running-windows-98-ebay-and-scraps/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-most-damning-allegation-in-the-twitter-whistleblowers-report&quot;&gt;The Most Damning Allegation in the Twitter Whistleblower’s Report&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claimed lax security at Twitter is bad news. But one clearly captures the extent of systemic issues. Engineers had extensive access to the social network’s live, deployed software platform with minimal logging and monitoring. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/mudge-twitter-whistleblower-security/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our selection of the best articles, code, and projects we found this past month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;consequences-of-inadequate-identity-management-in-github&quot;&gt;Consequences of Inadequate Identity Management in GitHub&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity and Access Management is a major area of concern for security teams, including source control management like GitHub. The blog article raises three major risks people should be aware of. In addition, we suggest taking a good look at the CI/CD system and the service accounts controlling production environments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cidersecurity.io/blog/research/the-consequences-of-inadequate-identity-management-in-your-github-organization/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-a-product-security-program&quot;&gt;Building A Product Security Program&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anshuman Bhartiya writes on his blog about the different aspects of building a product security program from scratch. He writes about the essential topics of risk appetite, prioritization, relationships, and empathy. This article is a great start for anyone who has to implement a secure development approach in an organization. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anshumanbhartiya.com/posts/building-product-security-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-a-headstart-on-post-quantum-cryptography&quot;&gt;Get A Headstart On Post-Quantum Cryptography&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography describes the fact practically all data sent over the Internet today is at risk in the future if a stable quantum computer is created. Cloudflare has released open-source software and experimental services to test post-quantum key agreements. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/experiment-with-pq/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cisco-data-breach&quot;&gt;Cisco Data Breach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cisco has confirmed a breach of its network, the attacker used voice phishing to convince an employee to accept a malicious multifactor authentication (MFA). With access established, the attacker then moved through the network by escalating privileges and logging into multiple systems. Cisco believes the threat actor is an initial access broker - an adversary that gains unauthorized access to networks and then sells that access on the Dark Web. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/cisco-confirms-data-breach-hacked-files-leaked&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cisco Talos did a great write-up with all the details related to the cyber attack. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/08/recent-cyber-attack.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lastpass-data-breach&quot;&gt;LastPass Data Breach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattackers have compromised the internal systems of the password management company LastPass, stealing source code and intellectual property. LastPass said it detected anomalous activity in its development environment. After a forensic investigation, it was determined that the attacker compromised a developer account to gain access to the network, taking intellectual property from the company. The adversaries weren’t able to access customer data or encrypted password vaults according to LastPass. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lastpass-developer-systems-hacked-to-steal-source-code/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;record-ddos-layer7-attack&quot;&gt;Record DDoS Layer7 Attack&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google reports a new record for DDoS on Layer 7: The Mēris botnet is believed to have sent a total of up to 46 million requests for HTTPS connections per second to the Google Cloud from 132 countries. The company compares the flood of data packets with all Wikipedia calls in an entire day, concentrated into ten seconds. According to its information, Google was able to fend off the attack. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-google-cloud-blocked-largest-layer-7-ddos-attack-at-46-million-rps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prioritize-vulnerability-management-with-ml&quot;&gt;Prioritize Vulnerability Management With ML&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a little suspicious of marketing fluff whenever we see machine learning and security mentioned in the same sentence, but researchers have now created a model for predicting which vulnerabilities will likely result in a functional exploit, an interesting tool for prioritizing patches and estimating risk. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/security-bugs-exploited-model-machine-learning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ssh-commit-verification-on-github&quot;&gt;SSH Commit Verification On GitHub&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest service provider for git repositories is now supporting commit verification with self-generated SSH keys. While GPG keys have been supported for a long time, we are now able to use SSH to give others confidence about the origin of a change. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-23-ssh-commit-verification-now-supported/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cloud-isolation-problem-postgresql&quot;&gt;Cloud Isolation Problem: PostgreSQL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tenant separation is a fundamental premise of the cloud and is at the core of trusting your cloud provider. The team of Wiz Research examined how effectively the environments of customers are isolated from each other across different cloud service providers and discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL offerings of major cloud providers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiz.io/blog/the-cloud-has-an-isolation-problem-postgresql-vulnerabilities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;read&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
