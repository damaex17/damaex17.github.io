        <title>Tor - 25 Years of Anonymization</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;anonymization-technology-is-at-the-core-of-self-defense-in-the-digital-world-in-this-article-we-take-a-look-at-the-great-anonymization-project&quot;&gt;Anonymization technology is at the core of self-defense in the digital world. In this article, we take a look at the great anonymization project.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying principle of Tor was developed in the mid-1990s by the United States to protect U.S. intelligence communications online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25 years after its inception as a state-funded project, Tor is the most important adversary of state surveillance and the leader in distributed anonymization technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tor-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;the logo of the Tor project&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows users to protect their privacy and circumvent censorship but also allows selling or buying illicit drugs. The Tor Project has been full of contradictions since the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;onion-routing&quot;&gt;Onion Routing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tor aims to conceal its users’ identities and their online activity from surveillance and traffic analysis by separating identification and routing. It is an implementation of a technique called onion routing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an onion network, messages are encapsulated in layers of encryption, analogous to several peels of an onion. The encrypted data is transmitted through a randomly selected series of network nodes called onion routers, each of which “peels” away a single layer, uncovering the data’s next destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the final layer is decrypted, the message arrives at its destination. The user remains anonymous to the service provider because each intermediary knows only the location of the immediately preceding and following nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deep-and-dark-onion&quot;&gt;Deep and Dark Onion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tor software can be used in two ways: either as an anonymization service to accesses the regular internet or to access services in the virtual top-level domain “.onion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many misunderstandings and generalizations regarding the “.onion”. Let’s look at some subsets of the web and the naming first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tor_users.png&quot; alt=&quot;tor users per day&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;SurfaceWeb&lt;/strong&gt; is everything publicly available and accessible through search engines. This is where we find news sites, blogs like inversegravity, or shopping sites. The &lt;strong&gt;DeepWeb&lt;/strong&gt; describes the parts of the internet that are hidden behind a login and therefore not publicly accessible. Examples are online banking sites or content behind a paywall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;DarkWeb&lt;/strong&gt; describes services that require specific software to access them. Tor is such software and the TLD “.onion” is a major player in the so-called DarkWeb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hostnames under “.onion” are not actual DNS names, and the TLD is not registered in the root of the regular internet domain services. The purpose of the network is to hide both the identity of the service provider and the person accessing the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mutual anonymity and the emergence of anonymous digital currencies created the possibility to buy and sell services and goods in complete anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-worth-the-costs&quot;&gt;Benefits worth the costs?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not without reason that stories about the Darkweb are popular in the media. There is everything that makes a good story, anonymous criminals engaging in illegal activities including sex and drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tor_users_country.png&quot; alt=&quot;tor users per country&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outrage from politicians and calls for regulation accompany many of these stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/11/24/2011893117/tab-article-info&quot;&gt;research article&lt;/a&gt; has shown that only ~6.7% of all Tor users are actually accessing Onion services for potentially illegal purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority uses it as a privacy-enhancing tool to circumvent censorship or stay anonymous on the regular internet. Ultimately Tor is by its very nature dual-use and the question is if the benefits outweigh the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 25th anniversary of Tor, there is no clear answer. The internet is a very young technology and we are grappling with the implications to personal freedom, censorship, human nature, social evil, and government policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday Tor!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures System</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures-system-provides-a-reference-method-for-publicly-known-information-security-vulnerabilities-and-exposures&quot;&gt;The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is maintained by the nonprofit organization &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_MITRE_Corporation&quot;&gt;MITRE&lt;/a&gt;, funded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Division&quot;&gt;NCSD&lt;/a&gt;, and was officially launched in 1999. In this article, we explain what it is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the CVE system, communication about security vulnerabilities was difficult. “The security issue in Windows” could refer to hundreds of individual bugs. Trying to narrow down the exact bug by adding the subsystem was not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/digisign.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture of a city&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve communication and avoid misunderstandings a vendor-neutral and uniform system for the management of vulnerabilities was required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, this consistent numbering system for vulnerabilities was introduced: the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) system, which has since become the industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vulnerabilities-and-exposures&quot;&gt;Vulnerabilities and Exposures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a software or system that can be used to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions on a computer system. Exposures are caused by vulnerabilities and misconfiguration and can be actively exploited in cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;naming-scheme&quot;&gt;Naming Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDs in the CVE system follow the format &lt;strong&gt;CVE-YYYY-NNNNN&lt;/strong&gt;. The pattern is familiar to everyone who has dealt with vulnerabilities and describe the specific issue with a software. Software updates refer to the CVE number to explain what is addressed in the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial &lt;strong&gt;CVE&lt;/strong&gt; is always followed by the year &lt;strong&gt;YYYY&lt;/strong&gt; in which the number was assigned to the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part of the ID was limited to four digits when the system was introduced but the 9999 unique IDs per year were insufficient. Since 2014 there is no limit and the length is defined by the demand of the respective calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allocation&quot;&gt;Allocation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uniform syntax of the CVE system was the first step to find a common ground for vulnerabilities. But to prevent IDs from being created and assigned in an uncontrolled manner, only certain organizations and persons, so-called CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs), have the authority to assign an ID to a specific vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of CNA entities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The MITRE itself functions as the primary CNA&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Various vendors assign CVE numbers for their products (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, Google, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third-party coordinators such as CERT may assign CVE numbers for products not covered by other CNAs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent researchers who discover a vulnerability and want to report it will find the relevant contact point in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html&quot;&gt;CNA overview&lt;/a&gt; on MITRE’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cvebanner.png&quot; alt=&quot;a server rack&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a new vulnerability is reported, the CNA will reserve an ID and enter it into the MITRE maintained &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cve/&quot;&gt;CVE list&lt;/a&gt;. Once the vulnerability is confirmed and a detailed description is provided, the CVE is officially assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-information-and-scoring&quot;&gt;Additional Information and Scoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Vulnerability Database (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/&quot;&gt;NVD&lt;/a&gt;) is an independent project launched in 2005 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/&quot;&gt;NIST&lt;/a&gt;) and uses MITRE’s CVE list, but adds additional information to the rather brief descriptions, such as security risks or available updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160&quot;&gt;Heartbleed CVE&lt;/a&gt; for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0160&quot;&gt;NVD description&lt;/a&gt; provides information on how to fix it and a list of affected software versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important data the NVD provides is the so-called Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Based on the path of attack and the complexity of the exploit, a scoring level from “Low” to “Critical” is assigned to each CVE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVE is free to use and publicly available to anyone interested in correlating data between different vulnerability or security tools, repositories, and services. Attackers only need to find a single vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to a system. Therefore, organizations need to protect themselves by swiftly addressing known vulnerabilities and exposures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CVE system provides the necessary infrastructure to match any software inventory against known weaknesses and the ID serves as the consistent identification characteristic for such vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zero Trust Security</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;zero-trust-is-a-model-that-is-based-on-the-idea-that-nothing-should-be-trusted-without-verification&quot;&gt;Zero Trust is a model that is based on the idea that nothing should be trusted without verification.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional networks, security is based on perimeter defenses, a concept that can be best described with the metaphor of a medieval castle. It is hard to gain access from the outside, but everyone inside is trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/computer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;old computer&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this perimeter defense approach is that once attackers have overcome the initial boundary of the network, they can freely act on all systems. This is intensified by today’s world of complex interconnected networks, cloud-based environments, working from home (WFH), and bring your own device (BYOD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the concept of barricading your castle with a single (fire)wall alone is an inadequate security model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter zero trust; a new way of thinking, driven by the assumption that threats are everywhere. Let’s take a look at some of the guiding principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microperimeter&quot;&gt;Microperimeter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zero trust model extends identity controls to all processes, systems, and people regardless of their group membership or by the location in the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Networks are therefore segmented into small zones and a person or program can’t access the resources in such a zone without prior authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting micro perimeter allows granular authentication that is tailored to an individual user/process/system combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principle-of-least-privilege&quot;&gt;Principle Of Least Privilege&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentication within a zero-trust philosophy is based on the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP). Meaningi, people and processes receive only the amount of access rights they need to carry out their duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework of policies and technologies for enabling this appropriate access to resources is called Identity and Access Management (IAM) and in conjunction with PoLP, it minimizes the exposure of services to malicious login attempts with valid accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-factor-authentication&quot;&gt;Multi-Factor Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In zero-trust security, knowledge of a password is not enough evidence for authentication. Multi-factor authentication is the recommended method in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/universal-2nd-factor/&quot;&gt;2FA&lt;/a&gt; as a subset of multi-factor authentication confirms identities by combining two different factors: something they know and something they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing MFA dramatically improves the security of the authentication process and prevents attacks with well-known or easy to brute-force passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tcp_02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a server rack&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;encryption-everywhere&quot;&gt;Encryption Everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data in public networks is by default encrypted in today’s world. Zero-trust additionally requires the consistent usage of transport layer security (TLS) in internal networks and the cryptographic protection of data in storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encryption algorithms and secure key sizes have to be assessed regular whether they remain sate of the art. But this effort is quickly compensated by the liberating knowledge that an attacker will have a harder time to move inside the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;observability&quot;&gt;Observability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioral analytics, efficient incident response, and forensics are important building blocks to support a zero-trust environment. The ability to develop such a cohesive overview requires observability for all services and events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, logging and metrics come to mind first, but observability involves other processes like monitoring, tracing, analytics, and alerting. Good observability enables the organization to compile meaningful information from all systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero Trust can only function within the framework of an overall security concept. It is not an off-the-shelf product or tool but rather a vendor-neutral principle for approaching security in an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It requires a cultural shift and flexible solutions to change the paradigms by which organizations secure their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Progressive Web Application</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;we-are-living-in-the-age-of-the-smartphone-and-native-apps-are-often-built-in-a-programming-language-specific-to-the-mobile-operating-system-a-progressive-web-application-pwa-on-the-other-hand-is-delivered-through-the-web-and-based-on-common-web-technologies&quot;&gt;We are living in the age of the smartphone and native apps are often built in a programming language specific to the mobile operating system. A Progressive Web Application (PWA), on the other hand, is delivered through the web and based on common web technologies.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PWA is intended to work on any platform and with any browser. The functionality includes working offline, push notifications, and even hardware access thus enabling user experiences similar to native applications on desktop and mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no need for developers or users to install a PWA via proprietary distribution systems like Google Play or Apple App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-and-how-to-pwa&quot;&gt;Why And How To PWA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Native apps on Apple iOS use Swift and Android apps are based on Java. Organizations that want to support both platforms are quickly confronted with having to build two expensive teams. Keeping both applications aligned is a neverending endeavor. There is no easy way to build one application and publish it to all the stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iphone.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot iOS screen&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width:45%; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive web applications on the other hand are a great way to have just that, a single app to rule them all and users might not even know that they are using a web-based app instead of a native one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/&quot;&gt;web.dev&lt;/a&gt; blog, the characteristics of a PWA are: capable, reliable, installable, and safe. The experience requires speed, network independence, and security from the web-based application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building blocks are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwabuilder.com/serviceworker&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;service worker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that handles network requests and the caching of assets to support an offline experience with the web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transport encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the network connection via TLS/HTTPS for all components of the website, which should be a standard today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwabuilder.com/generate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;manifest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file in JSON format to control the app appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any website can become a PWA by satisfying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwabuilder.com&quot;&gt;PWA checklist&lt;/a&gt;. Once all the requirements are met, the app can be downloaded to devices and mimics a native application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having to maintain separate native applications makes PWA especially interesting for small organizations. Major web frameworks like Angular, React or Jekyll enable developers to easily create a PWA, and all major mobile and non-mobile operating systems support the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inversegravity is now available as a PWA. We support web-applications and like to evade any iOS vs. Android rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data Anonymization</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;companies-use-data-science-and-analytics-to-improve-their-services-and-products-it-makes-a-lot-of-sense-to-measure-what-users-like-and-only-build-what-people-want-to-use&quot;&gt;Companies use data science and analytics to improve their services and products. It makes a lot of sense to measure what users like and only build what people want to use.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the collected data can be very sensitive and undermine the rights of users if a data loss occurs. Data privacy laws, therefore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/&quot;&gt;dictate&lt;/a&gt; appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organizations can’t afford highly restricted environments and are left with either limited data analytics or the risk of a data leak and resulting &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/fines-penalties/&quot;&gt;penalties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to protect data subjects and combine business needs with user rights is anonymization and in this article, we’ll gonna take a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest methods of anonymization is the removal (suppression) of direct personal identifiers from the data such as names or phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/anon_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;anonymization by removing the name&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width:60%; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until 1997, the resulting dataset was considered more or less anonymized and hospitals in the US, for example, released such data to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latanya_Sweeney&quot;&gt;Latanya Sweeney&lt;/a&gt; entered the stage and conducted a re-identification experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf&quot;&gt;successfully&lt;/a&gt; re-identified individuals by combining public medical records with other accessible records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “linkage attack” was born, where adversaries collect information from multiple data sources and then combine that data to re-create personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/anon_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;linkage attack&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width:45%; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latanya Sweeney conducted more research on re-identification and was met with publication challenges. The fear was that she is publicly exposing a serious issue with no known solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Forbes named Sweeney one of the most influential women in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of removing names and direct identifiers is considered pseudonymization if at all. Working with this data requires organizations to control the risk of a data breach since disclosure would affect the users rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anonymization&quot;&gt;Anonymization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, organizations have to provide evidence for anonymization since it exempts the business from strict data-privacy requirements. It has to be clearly documented why data subjects can no longer be identified directly or indirectly from the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most successful anonymization efforts involve the application of multiple techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;k-anonymity-protection-model&quot;&gt;K-Anonymity protection model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of k-anonymity was first introduced by Latanya Sweeney and Pierangela Samarati in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataprivacylab.org/dataprivacy/projects/kanonymity/kanonymity.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data is said to have the k-anonymity property if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k - 1 individuals whose information also appear in the release.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more personal attributes in a dataset, the harder it is to accomplish k-anonymity over all the attributes combined. Let’s consider this table of fictitious patient records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/anon_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;fictitious nonanonymized patient records&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two common methods to support k-anonymity are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppression&lt;/strong&gt; means that the values of attributes are replaced by a wildcard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generalization&lt;/strong&gt; describes the replacement of individual values of attributes to a broader category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following table we accomplished a 2-anonymity with respect to ‘Age’ and “Gender’ since for any combination of these attributes there are always at least 2 rows with the same value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/anon_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;patient records with 2-anonymity&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attributes ‘Age’ and ‘Gender’ are quasi-identifiers and when combined, can support re-identification to yield personally-identifying information. Each tuple of quasi-identifiers has to occur at least in k records of a dataset to accomplish k-anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K-anonymity is a promising approach for group-based anonymization given its simplicity, it is however susceptible to attacks. When background knowledge is available an attacker can use it to re-identify people. In the above example, background knowledge about the disease can support an attack on the anonymity of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred from k-anonymity data, the following methods have been created to further k-anonymity by additionally maintaining the diversity and closeness of sensitive fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The l-diversity Principle&lt;/strong&gt; An equivalence class is said to have l-diversity if there are at least l “well-represented” values for the sensitive attribute. A table is said to have l-diversity if every equivalence class of the table has l-diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The t-closeness Principle&lt;/strong&gt; An equivalence class is said to have t-closeness if the distance between the distribution of a sensitive attribute in this class and the distribution of the attribute in the whole table is no more than a threshold t. A table is said to have t-closeness if all equivalence classes have t-closeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;differential-privacy&quot;&gt;Differential Privacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique was developed by cryptographers and draws much of its language from cryptography. Simply put differential privacy introduces two methods to balance data usefulness and privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, an algorithm injects random noise into a data set to protect the privacy of an individual. The noise is small enough to enable analysts and researchers to provide useful insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the amount of information revealed is calculated and deducted from a so-called privacy-loss budget. The reference book for differential privacy is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/Algorithmic-Foundations-Differential-Theoretical-Computer/dp/1601988184/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Algorithmic+Foundations+of+Differential+Privacy%22&amp;amp;qid=1596537123&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy&lt;/a&gt;” by Aaron Roth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf&quot;&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; describing &lt;em&gt;local differential privacy&lt;/em&gt;. The interesting twist here is that the noise is added on the users’ smartphone even before the data is sent to the Apple backend servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting approach we have been discussing in the posting &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/privacy-client-shift/&quot;&gt;System Architecture - Shift To The Client&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history. As data about individuals is more detailed than ever, the need for a robust approach to data anonymization is no longer optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clever matching of different data collections and resulting de-anonymization threatens any approach. Organizations have to innovate and underline how they handle the obtained user data responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Network Vulnerability Scanner</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;networks-are-the-enabler-of-organizations-in-the-digital-age-the-dynamic-nature-of-on-premises-and-cloud-network-environments-requires-continuous-vulnerability-management-to-defend-against-the-ever-evolving-threat-landscape&quot;&gt;Networks are the enabler of organizations in the digital age. The dynamic nature of on-premises and cloud network environments requires continuous vulnerability management to defend against the ever evolving threat landscape.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll look at network scanning which is the process to identify and classify weaknesses in the network. It is a prerequisite for the successful mitigation of known vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/radar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture of a radar screen&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-vulnerability-scanner&quot;&gt;What is a vulnerability scanner?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability scanner is an application that detects the hosts in a network and attempts to identify the services that are exposed by those systems. This is often considered the reconnaissance phase of a scan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It then tries to catalog the software version of detected services and checks them against databases of vulnerabilities to identify security weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some scanners will also attempt to exploit services by using default or well-known credentials and or test for other &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/owasp-top-10/&quot;&gt;common security risks&lt;/a&gt;. This step is the vulnerability verification phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All network hosts and their vulnerabilities are stored in an inventory and once the scan is finished a report is created which can be used to improve the security posture of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a large number of commercial and open-source scanners available. Each comes with individual strengths and weaknesses and some companies run multiple scanners to protect their network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;external-and-internal&quot;&gt;External and internal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network scan for vulnerabilities can be performed from inside a network or from outside the protected perimeters. Both approaches aim to identify flaws that an attack can exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scan from external will document the services and potential vulnerabilities that are accessible directly from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the common occurrence of insecure cloud-based configurations, the external scans are especially important to gain confidence in the security posture of the setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal scans, on the other hand, aim to identify weaknesses inside the network and support a defense in depth security approach. These scans protect against threat actors or hackers that have already gained access to the local networki and try to exploit more systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tsunami---a-open-source-network-security-scanner&quot;&gt;Tsunami - a open-source network security scanner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has released a general-purpose network security scanner for detecting vulnerabilities. The project is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner/blob/master/docs/index.md&quot;&gt;Tsunami&lt;/a&gt; and is maintained by the open-source community on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tsunami.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tsunami by hokusai 19th century&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://nmap.org/&quot;&gt;nmap&lt;/a&gt; for the reconnaissance phase and tests for known passwords with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nmap.org/ncrack/&quot;&gt;ncrack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; for the exploitation of vulnerabilities are rather limited but this is expected to change in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsunami is a great way to get started with scanning networks for vulnerabilities. The project encourages collaboration and anyone can support it by adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner/blob/master/docs/howto.md#create_plugins&quot;&gt;detectors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-network-security-measures&quot;&gt;Other network security measures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scanning for known vulnerabilities is sometimes confused with other security measures. It is worthwhile to understand the different procedures and their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;penetration-test&quot;&gt;Penetration Test&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on the scope but in general a penetration test is a simulated cyberattack on computer systems, processes, and employees to evaluate the overall security posture of an organization. The tools and techniques used in such a pentest are the same a hacker would use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penetration tests can surface complex security weaknesses that require coordinated human activities, rather than the execution of automated code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;application-security-test&quot;&gt;Application Security Test&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A specialized vulnerability test for applications that include the analysis of the source code. Application security testing is effective in detecting known security issues with &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/software-supply-chain-security/&quot;&gt;software-components&lt;/a&gt; or hardcoded passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is static security testing (SAST) which aims in testing code before compilation and dynamic security testing (DAST) which examines the application during run-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;threat-detection&quot;&gt;Threat Detection&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this activity is the detection of malicious activities in the network. It includes the search for compromised systems, discovering the exfiltration of data, and the unmasking of malicious user behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools of the trade are a sophisticated &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management&quot;&gt;SIEM&lt;/a&gt; system, the monitoring of indicators and adaptive scanning for changes in the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities are actively exploited by attackers. Knowledge about the weaknesses in a network is the first step in a successful mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability scanning is therefore an important activity to improve the security of an organization’s network.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Security Awareness - Security Culture</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;many-organizations-incorrectly-assume-that-a-team-of-security-experts-can-protect-the-other-99-of-the-companys-workforce&quot;&gt;Many organizations incorrectly assume that a team of security experts can protect the other 99% of the company’s workforce.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;this-dangerous-mindset-persists-in-many-technical-product-and-development-teams-too-and-members-take-it-for-granted-that-the-security-team-will-keep-them-out-of-trouble&quot;&gt;This dangerous mindset persists in many technical product and development teams too, and members take it for granted that the security team will keep them out of trouble.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in reality, it’s the daily informed decision making of all employees that makes the security posture of an enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awareness as a concept aims at employees knowing about procedures, rules, and touchpoints with the security experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security culture, however, goes beyond that and emphasizes a healthy mix of knowledge and follow-through by all members of an organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/culture_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;artistic picture of a hackers hiding&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we want to take a look at some examples of how to increase awareness and, more specifically, create an impactful cybersecurity culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leadership---top-down-approach&quot;&gt;Leadership - Top-Down Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant shifts in an organization start at the highest level; the support of the executive team is, therefore, essential in building a security culture. The top management has to communicate cybersecurity as an organization-wide priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular reporting regarding the security situation of the organization and clear communication about the benefits of initiatives will help to build trust between the security team and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle managers work directly with employees and are therefore naturally an essential driver of security culture. By properly explaining requirements to their team and leading by example, team leads will get the security mindset transported to all departments. Getting middle management on board with security has a significant effect on cultural change. They are the multipliers of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen a lot of incidents where the management says that cybersecurity is important, but then they turn around and ask for exceptions—and that is the death knell of any cybersecurity program.”
    —Rob Clyde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An “we are in this together” security mentality is achieved by embedding a vision and mission with leaders. This gives all employees direction on what they need to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;training-and-awareness&quot;&gt;Training and Awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security training is labor-intensive but a key effort for growing and maintaining security culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educating the work-force requires different approaches depending on the specific needs of the target group. For example, it makes sense to run all newcomers through a basic security program with information on common social engineering attacks like phishing or malware, introducing them to secure behavior expectations, and how to report an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More tailored training for development teams can be, for example, introducing them to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/threat-landscape/&quot;&gt;Threat Landscape&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/owasp-top-10/&quot;&gt;OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe refresh some &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/crypto-history-basics/&quot;&gt;crypto&lt;/a&gt; knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Departments, like Human Ressources, on the other hand, require awareness of the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/personnel-security/&quot;&gt;Personnel Security&lt;/a&gt; and how they can help with keeping the workplace safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge transfer can take place in workshops, via videos or, maybe by introducing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html&quot;&gt;famous data-leak case&lt;/a&gt; to a broader group in the organization and how it could have prevented by aligning with the policy framework. Showing that threats are close is an excellent way to encourage employees to follow security policies and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security teams should also consider collecting feedback after a training to ensure the continuous improvement of the education program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/culture_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;artistic picture with data privacy message &quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secure-development-lifecycle&quot;&gt;Secure Development Lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure from the start to the end and repeat. SDL is elemental to a sustainable security culture since it enables security to be integrated from the early stages of the development processes, and not as an afterthought at the very end of the delivery pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a product through SDL will build trustworthy solutions that have fewer security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origin of most industry SDL implementations is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/practices&quot;&gt;Microsoft program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SDL is sustainable security culture in action and answers how to embed security culture in development and product teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rewards&quot;&gt;Rewards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate success and recognize the people that do the right thing for security. Positive reinforcement is an excellent practice to support the effort to build a community of security-aware employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding security-related goals to performance reviews will make reasonable security practices mandatory to employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A positive message to the entire organization is sent by giving employees with good risk awareness more freedom when making decisions. Distributing the responsibility for security is a significant goal of security culture and therefore has to be embedded in the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/culture_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;artistic picture with data privacy message &quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automation&quot;&gt;Automation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations can support employees by adding security automation to software development and daily processes. This will not only make the employee’s job more comfortable but can also significantly improve the security posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of good automation are security scanners, static code analysis, or automatically generated governance documents. Providing security plugins for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment&quot;&gt;IDE&lt;/a&gt; of developers shifts the feedback to the left, and takes the frustration out of a later deployment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security culture is an integral part of a corporate culture that encourages people to make decisions in alignment with the organization’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a long-term and never-ending endeavor to break down silo thinking and create a sense of companywide ownership for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees have to be seen as assets in this approach; they are the first line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Security Awareness - Threat Landscape</title>
        <description>&lt;h5 id=&quot;information-security-awareness-focuses-on-raising-consciousness-regarding-risks-from-the-continuous-evolving-threats-to-organizations-businesses-and-individuals&quot;&gt;Information security awareness focuses on raising consciousness regarding risks from the continuous evolving threats to organizations, businesses, and individuals.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;attackers-evolve-their-capabilities-and-develop-more-technically-advanced-attack-methods-and-are-acting-on-more-diverse-motives&quot;&gt;Attackers evolve their capabilities and develop more technically advanced attack methods, and are acting on more diverse motives.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals of security awareness is to raise conscious with everyone that they are vulnerable to the challenges in today’s threat landscape, change human risk behaviors, and implement a security culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hacker_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture of ants&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we take a look at threat actors and attacks to provide an overview of the current threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;threat-actors&quot;&gt;Threat Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A threat actor is a person or entity that is responsible for an event that impacts the safety or security of another entity. The term is used to describe the individuals and groups that perform malicious attacks against organizations of various types and sizes. Actors are categorized as external or internal an can be intentional or unintentional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following categories are a general overview. Threat actors are in reality more complex in their motivation and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;hacktivists&quot;&gt;Hacktivists&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacktivism is mainly portrayed as the evolution of meatspace civil disobedience into cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common motivation is the fight against censorship and the support for the freedom of information but some hacktivists work for personal and or political gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically hacktivists see themselves as vigilantes who use hacking to enact social justice and policy change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;industrial-espionage&quot;&gt;Industrial Espionage&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial espionage aims at stealing intellectual property, data, and secrets to use them for a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actors in this category are usually well-financed and use a mix of cyber and physical actions to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hacker_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture of a hacker building tool&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;organized-crime&quot;&gt;Organized Crime&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criminals are motivated by making money. The digital equivalent of kidnapping or robbery offers greater scalability and much lower risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organized crime has been quick in adapting themselves to the opportunities of making money with online activities. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware&quot;&gt;Ransomeware&lt;/a&gt; and cryptojacking allow criminals to hide their identity and digital currencies make the laundering of money risk free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;insider-threats&quot;&gt;Insider Threats&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malicious intent of employees can have a devastating impact on the security posture of an organization. Valid accounts and knowledge of applied controls make it difficult to detect harmful actions or distinguish them from regular work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insider threats can be motivated by revenge, competition, money, or just by opportunity. Negligence or incompetence of employees can cause similar outcomes to the actions of a malicious actor inside the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;nation-states&quot;&gt;Nation States&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State-backed hackers are not exclusively focused on hacking into military systems. Nation-state attacks have been documented against critical infrastructures like financial institutes or energy providers with the intent to destabilize another country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With almost unlimited financial potential these attackers use sophisticated techniques to disrupt organizations by leaking confidential information or attacking the availability of critical systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;common-attacks&quot;&gt;Common Attacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of attack methods that are a threat to organizations and individuals working in both public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;distributed-denial-of-service-ddos&quot;&gt;Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DDoS attacks target the availability of systems. Its effectiveness is based on the coordinated usage of many computer which act in sync to attack a single endpoint. DDoS attacks try to exhaust the resources of systems by flooding them with requests. As a result, legitimate requests can no longer be answered or at least the service becomes too slow to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack is executed from many different IP addresses to prevent blacklisting and therefore distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;malware&quot;&gt;Malware&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malware or malicious software is intentionally developed to cause damage to a computer, clients, or network. Malware comes in various types including worms, viruses, trojan horses, ransomware, adware, backdoors, and spyware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malware targets the weaknesses of other software systems or relies on users to install them by pretending to be regular software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced malware will try to conceal itself by using polymorphic approaches. This means that the signature of such software will mutate over time, making it difficult to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hacker_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture of a video game&quot; style=&quot;left; margin: 5px 0px 5px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;advanced-persistent-threat-apt&quot;&gt;Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term describes a targeted attack against an organization or business with defined goals. Operators executing the attack have a full spectrum of techniques at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include open-source or commercial computer intrusion technologies, but can also extend to a state financed intelligence and intrusion program. APTs use continuous monitoring and interaction to achieve defined objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APT attacks are coordinated human activities, rather than the execution of automated code. The operators have a specific objective and are organized, motivated, skilled, and potentially well funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;phishing&quot;&gt;Phishing&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an attempt to gather sensitive information such as email addresses and passwords by disguising oneself as a entity of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phishing is a social engineering technique used to deceive users. Users are lured by communications purporting to be from trusted parties such as social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While phishing describes a broad and automated attack, the so called spear-phishing is a customized attack on a specific employee or organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security teams need to be proactive and improve their ability to properly defend themselves against current threats to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a detailed threat profile helps organizations with a clear illustration of the threats that they might face and supports an appropriate and tailored security program.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>System Architecture - Shift To The Client</title>
        <description>&lt;h6 id=&quot;the-network-dependency-of-an-terminal-user-of-the-70s-is-surprisingly-familiar-to-a-mobile-phone-user-in-the-2020s-without-a-connection-to-the-network-and-the-centralized-server-infrastructure-the-applications-are-not-working&quot;&gt;The network dependency of an terminal user of the 70s is surprisingly familiar to a mobile phone user in the 2020s. Without a connection to the network and the centralized server infrastructure, the applications are not working.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;having-its-roots-in-the-thin-clients-of-mainframe-multi-user-systems-the-server-centric-approach-was-challenged-by-the-emergence-of-powerful-personal-computers-in-the-80s-only-to-become-the-de-facto-standard-once-again-with-the-smartphone-revolution&quot;&gt;Having its roots in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client&quot;&gt;thin clients&lt;/a&gt; of mainframe multi-user systems, the server-centric approach was challenged by the emergence of powerful personal computers in the 80s, only to become the de facto standard once again with the smartphone revolution.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent advances in privacy laws and regulations, we might see another shift to the client as the place of data processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;client-server-architecture&quot;&gt;Client Server Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client-server model has two roles: the service user (client) and the service provider (server). The client requests and the server provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the design process of a client-server application, it is decided which parts of the task should be executed on the client, and which on the server. This decision can affect the robustness and security of the application as a whole. This will also have an effect on the cost of future modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/computer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;control room&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobile-applications&quot;&gt;Mobile Applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early smartphones had limited storage capacity and processing power. Hence mobile application development focused heavily on degrading the smartphone to a pure front-end experience while scalable backend systems provided computational power and storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business interests like analyzing usage patterns or digital rights management further pushed the server-centric agenda of mobile application architecture. End-users received device independence and cloud storage in return for giving up data to organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today companies implement server-centric architecture without a second thought and mobile application development is mostly reduced to work on fancy UX design and backend API integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/smartphone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;control room&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be time to re-think this approach since privacy laws emphasize user rights over company interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough of the theory and let’s look at a mobile application in the default server-centric setup, the privacy law implications and how it could be transformed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;symptom-checker-10&quot;&gt;Symptom Checker 1.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A symptom checker is the attempt to replace a doctor visit with an algorithm supported self-diagnosis. After providing some base information like the age and answering a couple of questions, the diagnosis is made. I will not go into the reliability of this kind of diagnosis but rather focus on the technical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average symptom checker takes user input and sends it to a backend server where the data is processed in clear text and the results are stored. This means that the correlation between medical and personal data is possible for anyone with access (intended or not) to those systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data cluster of a symptom checker is considered sensitive personal data and is located in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/&quot;&gt;highest data protection category&lt;/a&gt;. Appropriate technical and organizational measures have to be implemented to satisfy privacy laws like GDPR. This will be challenging for small to medium-sized organizations, especially when utilizing cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shift-to-the-client&quot;&gt;Shift To The Client&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handheld devices are also rapidly catching up to desktop computers in terms of computing power and memory. While the performance gap will never be completely closed, the additional abilities of smartphones open up the possibility for more flexibility in system design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question is how a different approach could look like and where to make the trade-offs? For an understanding of the future, I suggest looking to the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 80s the PC revolution set the trend from server-centric to client-centric. The mainframe was forecasted to be replaced by personal computers with locally installed business logic. The only thing a centralized server was required for was the sharing of files and as a backup solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;symptom-checker-20&quot;&gt;Symptom Checker 2.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm behind a symptom checker is reflected in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree&quot;&gt;decision tree&lt;/a&gt; since it only contains conditional control statements. It is therefore small in size and could easily be executed on a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating an application framework for different downloadable decision trees it is possible to run the logic entirely on the client and reduce the server involvement of a symptom checker app to that of a simple file service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No critical data would be centralized processed or stored. The user will stay in control and can make a conscious decision about donating data to improve the app or share the results with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, most users don’t care or know whether the application they are using runs locally or remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the responsibility of architects and engineers to make good decisions. Privacy laws force us to think about the data criticality and consider alternative approaches to the well-known default of server-centric applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE - May 2020: After successful protests of data protection advocates, the German government announced plans for a decentralized COVID-19 application. The contact tracing data will be store on the mobile devices of the users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GDPR - The Minimum</title>
        <description>&lt;h6 id=&quot;entrepreneurs-are-busy-people-having-to-distribute-their-precious-time-between-technical-implementation-marketing-and-monetization-data-privacy-is-not-very-high-on-the-list-of-things-that-need-to-get-done-but-the-gdpr-knows-no-mercy-or-the-concept-of-a-test-or-beta-phase&quot;&gt;Entrepreneurs are busy people having to distribute their precious time between technical implementation, marketing, and monetization. Data privacy is not very high on the list of things that need to get done, but the GDPR knows no mercy or the concept of a test or beta phase.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;as-soon-as-the-data-of-real-people-is-processed-the-rules-of-gdpr-apply-looking-into-data-privacy-in-the-early-stages-of-a-venture-prevents-bad-decisions-and-can-ultimately-shape-a-more-sustainable-business-plan&quot;&gt;As soon as the data of real people is processed, the rules of GDPR apply. Looking into data privacy in the early stages of a venture prevents bad decisions and can ultimately shape a more sustainable business plan.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I want to provide basic requirements and actions for young businesses to avoid privacy debt. Ignoring GDPR responsibilities can result in fines, invalidate the business case, leave organizations open to legal action, and negatively affect the credibility of the startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-this-is-important&quot;&gt;Why this is important&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; became enforceable on 25 May of 2018 and is a regulation for all member states of the EU. It affects all organizations that collect data from EU residents and has become a model for many national laws outside of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual turnover of the business. Solid investors will check if the paperwork of a startup includes the necessary documents regarding data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDPR compliance is an advantage, adding value to the business and giving customers the security that their rights are taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gdpr.png&quot; alt=&quot;gdpr is here to stay&quot; style=&quot;float: center; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lawyer-up&quot;&gt;Lawyer up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GDPR was written by lawyers and is filled with legal terms. To understand it requires to decipher the language and terms. Here are some basic explanations for common wording in the data privacy regulation law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Subjects&lt;/strong&gt; are individuals. The natural person whose data is being processed. This can be a customer or an employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Controller&lt;/strong&gt; describes the entity that “determines the purpose, condition, and means” of the processing of personal data. This is the entrepreneurs’ startup or a small company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Processor&lt;/strong&gt; is the entity that processes data on behalf of the Data Controller. Sometimes companies are the Controller and Processor at the same time, but the Processor role can also be outsourced to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Data&lt;/strong&gt; is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Examples are email addresses, names, birth dates, financial data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitive Personal Data&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of “special categories” that must be treated with extra caution. This category includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, health data, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/personnel_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;welcome&quot; style=&quot;float: center; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-privacy-mindset&quot;&gt;Data Privacy Mindset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the right approach, and by following a few rules, it is possible for small businesses to implement a robust strategy for data privacy. Collecting data of users is a responsibility that startups and entrepreneurs need to prioritize. The following points are by no means a GDRP compliance guide but a good foundation to build on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data classification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent way to start the process is by performing &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/data-classification/&quot;&gt;data classification&lt;/a&gt;. This must involve the data directly requested from users (e.g. name, email address, day of birth, password) and also data that is collected during the use of a service (e.g. log files, browser information, IP address). Documenting the categories of all data collected is the base for the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow of data provides the ability to implement appropriate protective measures. Those can be technical, organizational, or contractual. Documentation of where data is stored and which services are involved is essential. Data classification and data flow documentation underline the purpose of data processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party screening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t outsource risk nor responsibility. Startups need to choose third-party services not only by features but also with regards to their data privacy policy. A list of all service providers of a company has to be compiled, and the data and data categories shared with them have to be documented. The data flow diagram reveals what data is shared with which provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency and consent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal data can only be processed and stored with the consent of the user. The purpose of the data collection has to be made clear to the user, and any change to it requires new consent. Being transparent about data processing is a significant goal of the GDPR. Creating a transparent message of how customer data will be used builds company integrity and emphasizes the commitment to GDPR compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point of Contact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers have the right to request information about their data usage (data subject access requests) and can also request the erasure of their data. Every data processor needs to provide, therefore, a point of contact. Please keep in mind to properly authenticate a person before handing out information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-newsletter-example&quot;&gt;The Newsletter Example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our example startup develops a mobile application and has a promotional website where interested people can signup for a newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating a website and a newsletter are potent tools to build and maintain relationships with customers. But it requires a comprehensive &lt;strong&gt;privacy policy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;user consent&lt;/strong&gt; as personal data is being collected. The involvement of any &lt;strong&gt;third-party&lt;/strong&gt; has to be disclosed to the customer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s recap. The collection and processing of data from EU residents require the following disclosure of information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What data is processed? Just the email address, or is the startup collecting more information like IP address, country, and gender?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the purpose of the collection? In our case, this is market analysis, sending out newsletters and maybe selecting early adopters for the application. It’s essential to be specific about the purpose, and changes to the purpose require additional consent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The involvement of third parties has to be disclosed to the user. Which other companies receive the email address? Where is the data stored and processed?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the user contact the data processor and request the erasure of the data? Keep in mind that this includes the deletion of the data from third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applied-data-privacy-for-the-newsletter&quot;&gt;Applied Data Privacy for the Newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draft a comprehensive yet simple Privacy Policy and make it accessible to your users. With the collection of the above information, it will be easy to meet the obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following information has to be included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What personal information you collect&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you use it for&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you use third-party service&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The controls users have and how they can get into contact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The privacy policy is a passive document that gives information to the interested user, consent, on the other hand, is an explicit affirmative action that signifies agreement to the processing of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implied consent is no longer an option. Consent under GDPR has to be expressed - to ask for consent; the user has to understand the question and implication and then make a genuine choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an appropriate example of newsletter signup. The user is made aware of the purpose, and a link to the privacy policy is provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/consent.png&quot; alt=&quot;good consent&quot; style=&quot;float: center; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following example is non-compliant with GDPR. It implies consent to the processing activities, and the user is not made aware of what the signup means, what the data is used for or how to get more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/consent2.png&quot; alt=&quot;bad consent&quot; style=&quot;float: center; margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rights and freedoms of the user are violated by providing a non-transparent signup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a good foundation, it is possible to gradually mature the data privacy processes and supporting documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Record of processing activities&lt;/a&gt;, performing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Data protection impact assessment&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-36-gdpr&quot;&gt;consulting with the authorities&lt;/a&gt; are the next steps a company needs to take in accordance with GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data privacy is never done but instead a continuous process and has to be part of the DNA of any successful company.&lt;/p&gt;
