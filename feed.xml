        <title>Personnel Security</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Humans are the weakest element in any security solution. No matter what physical or logical controls are deployed, humans will discover ways to avoid, circumvent, subvert or disable them. Insider threats originate from past or present employees, contractors or business partners. They can misuse their inside knowledge or access to harm people, customers, assets or reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply security governance, an organization has to address the weakest link in the security chain - people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues, compromises, and problems related to humans occur at all stages and on all levels of an organization. People are involved throughout the development, implementation, and administration of a security solution and therefore have to be evaluated regarding their effect on the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong relationship between the security department and human resources is essential to maintain control and minimize risks in an organization. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/personnel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing employees&quot; style=&quot;left; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiring-people&quot;&gt;Hiring People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a secure environment, the first step of hiring new personnel is to create a &lt;em&gt;job description&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;position description&lt;/em&gt;. Without this description, there is no consensus on what type of individual should be hired. Personnel should only be added to an organization because there is a need for their specific skills and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description also has to include potential security issues originating from the position (e.g. handling of sensitive material or classified information). This classification of the position includes the type of access required (e.g. secure network) to perform the intended tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this information, the &lt;em&gt;screening of candidates&lt;/em&gt; can be performed. This involves background checks, verified reference calls, checking police and government records, and screening of social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hiring an individual, they need to sign an employment agreement. This document outlines the rules and restrictions of the organization, the security policies, and consequences of violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;separation-of-duties&quot;&gt;Separation of Duties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Separation of duties&lt;/em&gt; is a security concept in which sensitive, critical and significant work is divided among individuals. This prevents undermining or subversion of security mechanisms by an individual. It also reduces the risk of collusion which is the occurrence of negative activity by two or more people. Collusion is often performed for the purpose of fraud, theft, or espionage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting the power of individuals requires employees to work with others to commit large violations of security. Finding others to assist in a violation is more likely to leave behind detectable evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;job-rotation&quot;&gt;Job Rotation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rotating employees among multiple job positions help an organization to improve its overall security. Job rotation servers two functions. It provides knowledge redundancy and reduces the risk of fraud, data modification, theft, sabotage, and misuse of information. The longer a person works in a specific position, the more likely they are to be assigned additional tasks and therefore expand their privileges and access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job rotation requires that privileges and access rights have to be reviewed regularly to maintain the principle of &lt;em&gt;least privilege&lt;/em&gt;. In failure to do so, the employee will accumulate privileges over time. This is called &lt;em&gt;privilege creep&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;onboarding&quot;&gt;Onboarding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Onboarding&lt;/em&gt; is the process of adding a new employee to the identity and access management (IAM) system of an organization. The onboarding process is also performed when an employee’s role or position changes or when the person is awarded additional privilege or access rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/personnel_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing employees&quot; style=&quot;left; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboarding also refers to organizational socialization. In this process, the new employee is properly prepared for performing their job responsibilities. It includes training, job skill acquisition, and behavioral adaptation in order to integrate the employee efficiently into the existing processes and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;offboarding-and-termination&quot;&gt;Offboarding and Termination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personnel security lifecycle includes the &lt;em&gt;Termination&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Offboarding&lt;/em&gt; of the employee. This stage is very critical and numerous issues must be addressed in order to maintain a secure environment. Termination should be handled in a private and respectful manner but this does not mean that no precautions should be taken. Once the employee has been informed of their release, they need to be escorted off the premises and are no longer allowed to return to their work area without an escort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the release, all keys, badges, cards, tokens, and the work equipment have to be collected. When possible an &lt;em&gt;exit interview&lt;/em&gt; should be performed. In this conversation, the liabilities and restrictions should be reviewed. This includes obligations based on the employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, and any other security-related documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/personnel_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing employees&quot; style=&quot;left; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is essential to offboard the employee from the IAM system shortly before or while informing the employee about the termination. Botched termination processes can cause critical damage to the organization. The completeness of information in the IAM system is critical for this process of disabling network access and removing company accounts from the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vendor-consultant-and-contractors&quot;&gt;Vendor, Consultant, and Contractors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controls have to be defined for vendors, consultants, and contractors in order to define the expectation, compensation, and consequences for external entities to the own organization. These controls are defined and documented in a &lt;em&gt;service-level-agreement&lt;/em&gt; or SLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is best practice to put an SLA in place not only for external personnel but for all applications, connections, database, information systems, and any other critical part of an organizations infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By clearly defining the expectations and penalties for external parties, everyone involved knows what is expected of them and what the consequences are in case of a failure to meet the expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;onboarding&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;offboarding&lt;/em&gt; of external personnel have to follow the same procedures as the ones for regular staff.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptography - Asymmetric Key Algorithms</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the third in my series about cryptography. We will be diving into public-key cryptography with all its strength, weaknesses and implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/crypto-history-basics/&quot;&gt;First Part: Cryptography - History and Basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/crypto-symmetric/&quot;&gt;Second Part: Cryptography - Symmetric Key Algorithms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;asymmetric-key-algorithms-public-key---definition&quot;&gt;Asymmetric Key Algorithms (Public-Key) - Definition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public-Key cryptography is a relatively new system (compared to symmetric cryptography) and relies on the usage of a pair of keys. This pair is the private key and the public key. The generation of the key pair is based on cryptographic algorithms to produce a mathematical one-way function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this system, any person can encrypt a message using the receivers public key. The encrypted message can then only be decrypted with the receivers private key. Authentication is also possible when the sender is encrypting a &lt;em&gt;digital signature&lt;/em&gt; with his private key. Receivers with the matching public key can verify this signature to be valid by decrypting with the public key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternative terms: &lt;em&gt;public key cryptography&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Asymmetric key cryptography&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/key.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing keys&quot; style=&quot;left; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantage-of-asymmetric-key-cryptography&quot;&gt;Advantage of Asymmetric Key Cryptography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key distribution&lt;/strong&gt; is not an issue. Public Keys are meant to be made publicly available. There is no overhead for secret key distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonrepudiation&lt;/strong&gt; is ensured because a party cannot dispute its authorship of a document or communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt; the number of keys is directly proportional to the number of participants in the system. Each party has two keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Number of Keys = n * 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disadvantages-of-asymmetric-key-cryptography&quot;&gt;Disadvantages of Asymmetric Key Cryptography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow&lt;/strong&gt; public-key cryptography is notable slower than symmetric key cryptography&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rsa---rivest-shamir-and-adleman&quot;&gt;RSA - Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invented in 1977, the most famous public-key cryptosystem is named after its creators. They patented the algorithm and formed a commercial organization (RSA Security). Today, the RSA algorithm has been released into the public domain and is widely used in commercial and opensource products to archieve secure communication. RSA depends on the computational difficulty in factoring large prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Generation&lt;/strong&gt;[&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; two large prime numbers (approximately 200 digits each) are required -&amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; compute the product of those two numbers &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n = pq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:&lt;/strong&gt; now we need the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael%27s_totient_function&quot;&gt;Carmichael function  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;λ&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple&quot;&gt;the least common multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lcm&lt;/code&gt; to compute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;λ(n)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;λ(n) = lcm(λ(p),λ(q))&lt;/code&gt;,  since &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; are prime, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;λ(p) = p − 1&lt;/code&gt; and likewise &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;λ(q) = q − 1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;λ(n) = lcm(p − 1, q − 1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(p - 1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(q -1)&lt;/code&gt; are relatively prime, the two numbers have no common factors other than 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:&lt;/strong&gt; choose an integer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1 &amp;lt; e &amp;lt; λ(n)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcd(e, λ(n)) = 1&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor&quot;&gt;gcd is greatest common divisor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:&lt;/strong&gt; compute &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;d ≡ e−1 (mod λ(n))&lt;/code&gt;. This means &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse&quot;&gt;modular multiplicative inverse&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;e modulo λ(n)&lt;/code&gt;`.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public key consists of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private key is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;λ(n)&lt;/code&gt; must be kept secret or have to be discarded because they can be used to calculate &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob wants to send a secret message to Alice. Bob needs to know the public key of Alice to encrypt the message. Alice sends Bob her public key (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;) in a reliable, but not necessarily secret way. Alice keeps her private key (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;) and will never distribute it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message Bob wants to send is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; and he is in the possession of Alices public-key &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c = m^e mod n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be done rather quickly using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation&quot;&gt;modular exponentiation&lt;/a&gt;.
Bob then send &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; to Alice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice can recover Bobs message &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; by using her private key &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;m = c^d mod n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;el-gamal&quot;&gt;El Gamal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption&quot;&gt;El Gamal encryption system&lt;/a&gt; is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange. Dr. Taher El Gamal published an article in 1985, describing how the mathematics behind the Diffie-Hellman algorithm could be extended to support an entire public-key cryptosystem. El Gamal did not obtain a patent for his extension of Diffie-Hellman, unlike the then patented RSA technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Gamal has a major disadvantage which is that it produces a 2:1 expansion in size from plaintext to ciphertext. This presents an issue when encrypting long messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ecc---elliptic-curve-cryptography&quot;&gt;ECC - Elliptic Curve Cryptography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1985, two mathematicians independently proposed the application of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography&quot;&gt;elliptic curve cryptography&lt;/a&gt; to develop a secure cryptographic system. Neal Koblitz from the University of Washington and Victor Miller from IBM, suggested to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wstein.org/edu/2007/spring/ent/ent-html/node89.html&quot;&gt;elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem&lt;/a&gt; as the basis for this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any elliptic curve can be defined by the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;y^2 = x^3 + ax + b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this equation &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are all real numbers. Each elliptic curve has a matching &lt;em&gt;elliptic curve group&lt;/em&gt; made up of the points of the elliptic curve along with the point &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;, which is located in infinity. Two points within in the same elliptic curve group (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt;) can be added with an elliptic curve addition algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;P + Q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is extended by assuming that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; is a multiple of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Q = x^P&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians believe that it is extremely difficult to find &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, even if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; are known. It is widely accepted that this problem is harder to solve than both the &lt;em&gt;prime factorization problem&lt;/em&gt; of RSA and the &lt;em&gt;standard discrete logarithm problem&lt;/em&gt; of Diffie-Hellman/El Gamal. Because of this, a 160-bit ECC key is cryptographically equivalent to a 1024-bit RSA key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further reading on the detailed mathematics behind ECC, I can recommend the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://certicom.com/content/certicom/en/ecc-tutorial.html&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alteration-of-public-keys&quot;&gt;Alteration of public keys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier in this posting, public keys are meant to be in the public domain. The advantage of the systems is that communication can be encrypted between parties without previous interaction or knowledge. One common attack vector to public-key cryptography is exactly targeting this strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a so-called &lt;em&gt;man in the middle&lt;/em&gt; attack, the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party and then modified public keys are provided instead. Intercepted messages are decrypted and re-encrypted by the attacker to avoid suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is possible on all insecure media (e.g. wireless, public networks). One approach to prevent such attacks involves the usage of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/public-key-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;PKI&lt;/a&gt;. It describes a set of policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PKI has potential weaknesses like the correctness of a public key when a certificate is issued or the overall security resistance of an authority organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PKI system is commonly used to provide encryption for web traffic via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&quot;&gt;TLS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptography - Symmetric Key Algorithms</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the second in a series about cryptography. This time we look at symmetric cryptography, the advantages, disadvantages, and implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/crypto-history-basics/&quot;&gt;First Part: Cryptography - History and Basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;symmetric-key-algorithms---definition&quot;&gt;Symmetric Key Algorithms - Definition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric Key Algorithms are based on a shared secret key which is distributed to all members participating in the encrypted communication. The key is used to encrypted and decrypt the message. The sender and receiver are both in the possession of a copy of the shared key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When large keys are used, the symmetric encryption is very difficult to break. The primary use case for it is bulk encryption (eg. hard drives) with a high speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternative terms: &lt;em&gt;private key cryptography&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;shared private key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/symmetry.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing symmetry&quot; style=&quot;left; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantage-of-symmetric-key-cryptography&quot;&gt;Advantage of Symmetric Key Cryptography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure&lt;/strong&gt; Symmetric Key Cryptography is extremely secure if it is used with a secure algorithm, and a large key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast&lt;/strong&gt; Encrypting and Decrypting symmetric key data is considerably faster than in asymmetric key algorithms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disadvantages-of-symmetric-key-cryptography&quot;&gt;Disadvantages of Symmetric Key Cryptography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key distribution&lt;/strong&gt; is a major problem since parties must have a secure method of exchanging the secret key before communication can be established. The method of offline key distribution is called out-of-band exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonrepudiation&lt;/strong&gt; is not given since each party uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt. There is no way to prove the origin of a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not scalable&lt;/strong&gt; secure communication in a group can only be achieved if each possible combination of users exchanges a shared private key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Number of Keys = (n(n-1)/2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key regeneration&lt;/strong&gt; all keys must be regenerated if one user leaves the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;des---data-encryption-standard&quot;&gt;DES - Data Encryption Standard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data Encryption Standard or DES is a symmetric-key algorithm that was developed in the early 1970s. Its short key length of 56-bit (+8 bit parity) was criticized from the beginning. Nowadays this algorithm is no longer recommended for use since intelligence agencies are believed to routinely decrypt DES-encrypted information. This algorithm is nevertheless important to understand because it is highly influential for the more advanced modern cryptography algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DES is the archetypal block cipher - an algorithm that takes a fixed-length string of plaintext bits (DES: 64-bit) and transforms it into a ciphertext string of the same length. In the case of DES, the transformation is accomplished by an exclusive OR (XOR) operation. This process is repeated 16 times for each encryption/decryption operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It supports 5 different modes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Code Book Mode - ECB&lt;/strong&gt; is the simplest mode and the least secure. Each time the algorithm processes a 64-bit block, it simply encrypts the block using the secret key. Encrypting the same block twice produces the same result. This makes the mode vulnerable to building a “code book”. After a sufficient number of encrypted blocks are gathered, cryptoanalytic techniques could decipher some of the blocks and break the encryption. ECB was only used for the exchange of small amounts of data such as keys or parameters or for encrypting the fields in a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cipher Block Chaining Mode - CBC&lt;/strong&gt; describes the mode in which each unencrypted block of text is XORed with the block of ciphertext preceding it before it is encrypted. The decryption process simply reverses this behavior. CBC introduces an &lt;em&gt;initialization vector (IV)&lt;/em&gt; and XORs it with the first block of the to be encrypted message. This IV is sent to all recipients either in plaintext or by using ECB. The main problem of CBC is that errors in the message propagate. One corrupted block makes it impossible to decrypt the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cipher Feedback Mode - CFB&lt;/strong&gt; is simply the streaming version of CBC. It operates against data in real-time. Instead of working with 64-bit blocks of text is uses a memory buffer of the same block size. It encrypts the buffer once it is full and sends it to the recipients. CFB operates in the same fashion as CBC, it uses an IV and is chaining the blocks (buffers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output Feedback Mode - OFB&lt;/strong&gt; operates on streaming data with buffers in the same way as CFB. However, instead of XORing the encrypted version of the previous block (buffer), it uses a seed value as the IV. Future seed values are derived by running the DES algorithm on the previous seed value. The biggest advantage of this mode is that there is no chaining function and therefore errors do not propagate. This makes the mode more robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter Mode - CTR&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to OFC but instead of creating the seed value for each encryption/decryption from the results of the previous seed values, it uses a simple counter and increments it for each operation. As with OFB mode, errors do not propagate in CTR mode. CTR also allows to break the operation (encryption/decryption) in multiple steps and is therefore well suited for parallel computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3des---triple-des&quot;&gt;3DES - Triple DES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 56-bit key of DES is no longer considered adequate in the times of modern cryptoanalytic and the availability of almost endless computational power (cloud). An adapted version of called Triple DES or 3DES uses the same algorithm to produce more secure encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four versions of 3DES:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DES-EEE3&lt;/strong&gt; encrypts the plaintext 3 times using 3 different keys (K1, K2, and K3) and runs 3 encryption operations. It has an effective key length of 168-bit. (P = plaintext, E = encryption)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,P)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DES-EDE3&lt;/strong&gt; uses also 3 keys but replaces the second encryption operation with a decryption operation. The key length is 168-bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,P)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DES-EEE2&lt;/strong&gt; uses only 2 keys as follows and has an effective key length of 112-bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;E(K1,E(K2,E(K1,P)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DES-EDE2&lt;/strong&gt; uses 2 keys and replaces the second encryption operation with a decryption operation. The key length is 112-bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,P)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;idea---international-data-encryption-algorithm&quot;&gt;IDEA - International Data Encryption Algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDEA was developed in response to the criticism of the insufficient key length of DES. Like DES it operates on 64-bit blocks or buffers of plaintext/ciphertext. It begins the operation with a 128-bit key which is broken up in 56x 16-bit subkeys. The subkeys are then used in a combination of XOR and modulus to produce the encrypted/decrypted version of the input message. IDEA is operating with the same five modes of DES: ECB, CBC, CFB, OFC, and CTR. One well-known implementation of IDEA is Phil Zimmerman’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blowfish&quot;&gt;Blowfish&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another alternative to DES and IDEA is Bruce Schneier’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)&quot;&gt;Blowfish&lt;/a&gt; block cipher. It also operates with 64-bit blocks of text but allows to define the key length ranging from a relative insecure 32-bit to an extremely strong 448-bit. With longer keys, the encryption/decryption time obviously increases. Blowfish was released for public use and is built in a number of commercial and open source products (eg. SSH, or Linux).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skipjack&quot;&gt;Skipjack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This algorithm uses 64-bit blocks of text and an 80-bit key. It supports all modes of operation of DES and was adopted by the U.S. government. It has an added &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; of supporting the escrow of encryption keys. Two government agencies (National Institute of Standards and Technology - NIST and Department of Treasury - DOT), hold a portion of the information required to reconstruct a Skipjack key. Law enforcements can obtain the pieces of keys, and decrypt Skipjack communication. This algorithm was obviously not embraced by the cryptographic community but is in wide use with the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rc2rc5---rivest-cipher-rsa&quot;&gt;RC2/RC5 - Rivest Cipher (RSA)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a symmetric key algorithm patented by Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) Data Security and is found in commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RC2 uses a block size of 64-bit and a key size of 128-bit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RC5 uses a block size of 32, 64, or 128-bit and a variable key size ranging from 0 - 2040-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aesrijndael---advanced-encryption-standard&quot;&gt;AES/Rijndael - Advanced Encryption Standard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&quot;&gt;AES&lt;/a&gt; allows three key strengths: 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits and encrypts 128-bit blocks of text. The underlying block-cipher Rijndael exceeds the AES specification and allows to use a block size equal to the key length. The number of encryption rounds in AES depends on the key length:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;128-bit key -&amp;gt; 10 rounds of encryption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;192-bit key -&amp;gt; 12 rounds of encryption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;256-bit key -&amp;gt; 14 rounds of encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;twofish&quot;&gt;Twofish&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Twofish was also developed by Bruce Schneier and was a finalist in the AES contest. Twofish is a block cipher and operates on 128-bit blocks of data. It is capable of using key sizes ranging from 1 - 256-bit in length. Twofish introduces two new techniques which are not found in other algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prewhitening&lt;/strong&gt; is the process of XORing the plaintext with a separate subkey before the first round of encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postwhitening&lt;/strong&gt; uses a similar operation after the 16th round of encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distribution-of-symmetric-keys&quot;&gt;Distribution of Symmetric Keys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges of symmetric encryption algorithms is the secure distribution the secret keys. There are three general methods used to exchange keys securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline Distribution&lt;/strong&gt; This is the technically most simple method and requires the physical exchange of the key material in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#Related_terminology&quot;&gt;meatspace&lt;/a&gt;. One party provides the other with a medium (e.g. sheet of paper, or flash drive) which contains the secret key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Key Encryption&lt;/strong&gt; Here we overcome the hassle of secret key distribution by using public key encryption for the initial setup of the communication (exchange of secret key). Once the secret key has been exchanged, the communication switches to a secret key algorithm to benefit from increased processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diffie-Hellman&lt;/strong&gt; There are use-cases where offline distribution is not feasible (no physical means) and public key encryption is not available (lack of &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/public-key-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;public key infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;). In a situation like this so-called key exchange algorithms like Diffie-Hellmann are useful mechanisms to exchange the secret key to enable symmetric key communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Bob and Alice have to agree on two large numbers. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; (prime number) and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; (integer) such that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1 &amp;lt; G &amp;lt; P&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Bob now chooses a random large integer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; and performs the following calculation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;B = G^R mod P&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Alice chooses a random large integer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; and performs the following calculation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A = G^S mod P&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Bob sends &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; to Alice and she sends &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; to Bob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; Bob performs the following calculation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;K = A^R mod P&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; Alice performs the following calculation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;K = B^S mod P&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point both Bob and Alice have the same value &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;, and can use this for communication with a symmetric key algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cryptography - History &amp; Basics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the first in a series about cryptography. In this article, I look at the evolution of crypto and famous historical implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;history-of-cryptography&quot;&gt;History of Cryptography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speech and written communication defined the early civilizations and continuously evolved with human societies. In the beginning, humans used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph&quot;&gt;Petroglyphs&lt;/a&gt;, which evolved into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictogram&quot;&gt;Pictograms&lt;/a&gt; (Hieroglyphs), and finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideograms&quot;&gt;Ideograms&lt;/a&gt; and today we use flash storage devices stuffed with the information of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Scholastic-Flash-Drive-Encyclopedia-Britannica/dp/B003DKK9KK&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crypto_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing encrypted data&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as humans have been communicating, they tried to hide the true meaning of the written word from their enemies. Ancient civilizations used complex systems of secret symbols. The evolution of those systems are the codes and ciphers we facilitate to enable private communication in our times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;substitution-cipher-caesar-cipher&quot;&gt;Substitution Cipher: Caesar Cipher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In crypto, the Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known systems and was used by Julus Caesar to communicate with Cicero in Rome while he was conquering Europe. It is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a right shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called ROT3 (Rotate 3) cipher and encrypted/decrypted is mathematically implemented by converting each letter to its decimal equivalent. A is 0 and Z is 25. The wrap-around is done by using the modulo function. (C = ciphertext, P = plaintext)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crypto_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing Alphabet to Number relation&quot; style=&quot;middle; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;decrypted message: &lt;strong&gt;WINTER_IS_COMING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;math to encrypt: C = (P+3) mod 26&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crypto_6.png&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing Alphabet to Number relation&quot; style=&quot;middle; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;encrypted message: &lt;strong&gt;ZLQWHU_LV_FRPLQJ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;math to decrypt: P = (C-3) mod 26&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cipher is easy to use but also easy to crack. The cipher is vulnerable to &lt;em&gt;frequency analysis&lt;/em&gt; since the most common letters in the English language are E, T, A, O, N, R, I, S, and H. Attackers just need to find the common letters in the encrypted text (in my example the letter “I”) and experiment with substitution to break the cipher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transposition-cipher-rail-fence-cipher-zigzag-cipher&quot;&gt;Transposition cipher: Rail Fence Cipher (ZigZag Cipher)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rail fence cipher was used by the ancient Greeks in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale&quot;&gt;scytale&lt;/a&gt;, a mechanical system of producing a transposition cipher. The system consisted of a cylinder and a ribbon that was wrapped around the cylinder. The message to be encrypted was written on the coiled ribbon. The letters of the original message would be rearranged when the ribbon was uncoiled from the cylinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to write the plain text downwards and diagonally on successive “rails” of an imaginary fence, then moving up when the bottom rail is reached. When the top rail is reached, the message is written downwards again until the whole plaintext is written out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;message: &lt;strong&gt;JON_SNOW_IS_A_TARGARYEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 rail fence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crypto_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing Rail Fence Cypher&quot; style=&quot;left; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;encryption with a 3 rail fence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crypto_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing Rail Fence Cypher&quot; style=&quot;left; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;encrypted message: &lt;strong&gt;JS_ARYO_NWI__AGRENOSTAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message was easily decrypted when the ribbon was recoiled on a cylinder of the same diameter or by trying out multiple fence methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advanced-substitution-one-time-pads&quot;&gt;Advanced Substitution: One-Time Pads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A one-time pad is an extremely powerful type of cipher and uses a different substitution alphabet for each letter of the plaintext message. It can be represented by the following function. (C = ciphertext, P = plaintext, K = encryption key)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crypto_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing Alphabet to Number relation&quot; style=&quot;middle; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;decrypted message: &lt;strong&gt;WINTER_IS_COMING&lt;/strong&gt; 22 08 13 19 04 17 08 18 02 14 12 08 13 06&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one-time pad: &lt;strong&gt;ZVFXZVFXZVFXZV&lt;/strong&gt; 25 21 05 23 25 21 05 23 25 21 05 23 25 21&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;math to encrypt: C = (P+K) mod 26&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crypto_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing Alphabet to Number relation&quot; style=&quot;middle; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;encrypted message: &lt;strong&gt;VDSQDM_NP_BJRFNMB&lt;/strong&gt; 21 03 18 16 03 12 13 15 01 09 17 05 12 01&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;math to decrypt: P = (C-K) mod 26&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of one-time pads is that there is no repeating pattern of alphabetic substitution. This cipher is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_security&quot;&gt;Information-theoretical-secure&lt;/a&gt;. It is an unbreakable encryption scheme if the following requirements are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The one-time pad must be randomly generated without the use of a reoccurring pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The one-time pad must be protected against disclosure. The message can be easily decrypted if the adversary has a copy of the pad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each pad can only be used once (one-time). Reusing the same pad on multiple messages makes it possible to determine the key value used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The key must be at least as long as the message so each character of the key is used to encrypt one character of the message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the one-time pad is broken as soon as one of those requirements is not met. One of the major intelligence successes of the United States during the Cold War was when US cryptoanalysts broke the top-secret Soviet cryptosystem that relied on a one-time pad. The project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project&quot;&gt;VENONA&lt;/a&gt; discovered a pattern in the key values. The Soviets violated rule number one of one-time pad crypto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My example does it as well by just repeating the same key (ZVFX).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One-time pads have been used throughout history to protect sensitive communication. The major challenge of the system is the generation, distribution and, safeguarding of the key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;code-breaking&quot;&gt;Code Breaking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis&quot;&gt;Frequency analysis&lt;/a&gt; is the basic tool for breaking most classical ciphers. It utilizes the fact that in languages, certain letters of the alphabet appear more often than others. With a long enough ciphertext a reasonable representation count of letters can be created and ultimately the code be broken. In the 15th century the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher&quot;&gt;Vigenère cipher&lt;/a&gt; (polyalphabetic substitution aka series of interwoven Caesar ciphers) was invented and considered to be completely secure (le chiffre indéchiffrable—”the indecipherable cipher”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During World War I and World War II the deciphering of messages played a significant part in the success of a campaign. The US/UK broke the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_cipher&quot;&gt;Lorenz Cipher&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine&quot;&gt;Enigma Machine&lt;/a&gt; which is said to have played a decisive factor in the Allied victory. The Germans broke the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_code_breaking_in_World_War_II&quot;&gt;Naval Code #3 and #5&lt;/a&gt; which enabled the early successes in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic&quot;&gt;Battle of the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the Information or &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/cyber-warfare-domain/&quot;&gt;Cyber Domain&lt;/a&gt; is an official dimension of modern warfare. Intercepting the enemies communication and deciphering the information is a common theme with all major military powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/crypto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a picture representing encrypted data&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data Classification</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Data is the oil of the 21st century. Information, knowledge, and data are all closely related concepts, but each has its own role in relation to the other. In this article I will treat them as one. [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-the-classification-of-data-important&quot;&gt;Why is the classification of data important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is inefficient to treat all data the same way when implementing protection for the data assets of an organization. Securing everything with few or no safeguards (controls) means sensitive data might get exposed. Securing everything at a high-security level is expensive and restricts access to noncritical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classification of data is helpful to determine how much effort, resources, and money is allocated to protect data and control access to it. It is important to classify the protection level of data with the input from legal, regulatory, business, and technical experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Categorization is the process of organizing objects into groups with similarities. The similarities can be value, sensitivity, risk, vulnerability, or damage upon loss. Classification is used to provide mechanisms for processing, storing, or transferring data and also defines how data is removed or destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declassification is required once an object no longer matches the similarities of other objects in the same category. Without declassification, resources are wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of using data classification schemes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It assists in identifying assets that are most critical and valuable to an organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It demonstrates an organizations commitment to protecting valuable resources and assets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It helps in the selection of protection mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is often required for regulatory and legal compliance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It assists in defining access levels for authorized users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/data.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture representing data&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two commonly used classification schemes are government/military and commercial business/private sector classification levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-and-military-classification-scheme&quot;&gt;Government and Military Classification Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are five levels of classification in this scheme. This scheme varies from country to country. [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Top Secret&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Secret&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Confidential&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sensitive but unclassified&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Unclassified&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Secret&lt;/strong&gt; is the highest level of classification. The disclosure of top-secret data will cause &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; damage to national security. This category of data/information is only provided on a need-to-know basis to users. Even users with top-secret clearance will not get access to data until the user has to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secret&lt;/strong&gt; is used for data of a restricted category. Disclosure of secret data will have a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; effect on national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidential&lt;/strong&gt; classification is used for all data between secret and sensitive but unclassified. The disclosure of confidential data will have a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; effect on national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitive But Unclassified&lt;/strong&gt; is used for data that is for internal use or office use only. SBU is often used for data that violates the privacy rights of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unclassified&lt;/strong&gt; is data that is neither sensitive nor classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revealing the classification label of classified data is already considered a violation of the protection level. Top Secret, Secret and Confidential data are therefore commonly called &lt;em&gt;classified data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commercial-business-and-private-sector-classification-levels&quot;&gt;Commercial Business And Private Sector Classification Levels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only 3 levels in this classification scheme. The scheme can be adapted to a specific use-case. The University of Berkley is, for example, categorizing data in 4 levels [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Confidential/Private&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sensitive&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Public&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidential&lt;/strong&gt; is used for data that is extremely sensitive and for internal use only. A &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; negative impact for the organization will occur upon disclosure of data in this category. Another term for this level of classification is &lt;strong&gt;proprietary&lt;/strong&gt;. If proprietary data is lost, it can have an effect on the competitive advantage of a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private&lt;/strong&gt; is used for data that is of a private or personal nature. It is intended for internal use only. The disclosure of private data will have a negative impact on the company or individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitive&lt;/strong&gt; is used for data that is not intended for the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public&lt;/strong&gt; is the lowest classification level. It is used for all data that does not match the higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ownership-of-data&quot;&gt;Ownership of Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ownership has to be considered in the context of data classification. It can override all other forms of access control. Any operating system or application where files or other types of objects can be assigned to an owner has to be taken into consideration and a security policy has to be enforced to help categorize the content. An owner has full capabilities and privileges over an object they own. The ability to take ownership is often only granted to the most powerful user in an operating system (eg Linux root user or Windows Administrator) or to the creator of an object/file (Goole Docs).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sci-Fi Reality - Cyberwar</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hackers of a terrorist group are killed by a smart bomb just minutes after they start a cyber attack. Sounds like science fiction but the cyber domain just received its first immediate kinetic response. This sounds like a science fiction story - what the cyber?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;art-sci-fi-military-doctrine&quot;&gt;Art, Sci-Fi, Military Doctrine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word Cyber became popular when internet, digital communication, and digital identities were all emerging and the term “Cyberspace” was able to describe the new phenomena and ideas. It has been called the largest unregulated and uncontrolled domain in the history of mankind[&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] and is also unique because it is a domain created by people contrary to the traditional physical domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term Cyberspace was coined when Danish artist Susanne Ussing (1940-1998) and her partner architect Carsten Hoff (b. 1934) founded Atelier Cyberspace. The two made a series of installations and images entitled “sensory spaces” that were based on the principle of open systems adaptable to various influences, such as human movement and the behavior of new materials[&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first usage of Cyberspace in the context of online computer networks was in the 1980s when science fiction author William Gibson used the term in his cyberpunk books &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Chrome&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Burning Chrome&lt;/em&gt; (1982)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt; (1984)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cyber.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture of hacker&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts… A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters, and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding. (Neuromancer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer is a cult classic of the science fiction subgenre cyberpunk. The story of Case, Molly, Armitage, the AIs Wintermute and Neuromancer, and the Turing Police are unforgotten and quickly became an underground hit.
Today the book is considered “the archetypal cyberpunk work”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military Doctrine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1995 General Ronald R. Fogleman, Air Force chief of staff delivered a speech to the Armed Forces Communications-Electronics Association [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this speech, he defined a new dimension of Warfare. Information. Later the scope was extended beyond the original information operations background, focusing on “the advanced space-time manipulating capabilities cyberspace offers” and resulting in “Advanced Battlespace and Cybermaneuver Concepts” [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today all major military contenders and alliances [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] operate in the 5 dimensions (domains) of warfare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Land&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Air&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Space&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cyber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domains are not seen as silos of their own but are connected and operations are carried out in multiple dimensions to form the battlefields of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyberwarfare&quot;&gt;Cyberwarfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberwarfare consists of both offensive and defensive operations like espionage, sabotage, and cyber attacks. Powers have been developing cyber capabilities and have engaged in offensive and defensive activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard A. Clarke defines it as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.”[&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] Martin Libicki defines two types of cyberwarfare: Strategic and operational, with strategic being “a campaign of cyberattacks one entity carries out on another”, whilst operational cyberwarfare “involves the use of cyberattacks on the other side’s military in the context of a physical war.”[&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other definitions include non-state actors, such as companies, terrorist groups, political or ideological extremist groups, terrorist hacktivists, and transnational organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espionage&lt;/strong&gt; or Cyber-espionage is generally assumed ongoing between all major powers. One example is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)#Disclosures&quot;&gt;massive spying&lt;/a&gt; of the US in many countries as it was revealed by Edward Snowden. Espionage is not considered an act of war but the word attack is often used in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabotage&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber attacks with the goal of interruption or interception is a major threat to the functionality of the military and civilian infrastructure. Examples are the attack of US/Israel against Iran with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet&quot;&gt;Stuxnet worm&lt;/a&gt; or the attack of Russia against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2015_Ukraine_power_grid_cyberattack&quot;&gt;Ukrainian power grid&lt;/a&gt;. The attack surface of nation-states will increase with a broader adaption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things&quot;&gt;IOT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0&quot;&gt;Industry 4.0&lt;/a&gt;. State player attacks against banks with the purpose of disrupting the economy of adversaries is an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propaganda&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber-propaganda is an effort to control or manipulate public opinion. It utilizes social-media, fake websites, and other digital channels to de-legitimize the political system. The internet provides low-cost access to a wide audience and provides a feedback loop regarding the efficiency of propaganda. Countermeasures are affecting the freedom of speech principle of liberal societies and can turn into the perception of censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;latest-development&quot;&gt;Latest Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been controversy over whether cyber operations can be called a declaration of war. The US moved forward in 2011 and made clear that a kinetic response to cyberattacks is a viable option [&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 the US became the first country to respond with military force to a cyberattack. A remote-controlled drone killed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dod.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/615305/iraq-progresses-in-isil-fight-key-extremist-confirmed-dead/&quot;&gt;British citizen&lt;/a&gt; who was involved in the release of personally identifiable information of about 1,300 U.S. military and government employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An now in 2019 Israel became the first country to respond with &lt;strong&gt;immediate&lt;/strong&gt; military force to a cyberattack. The Hamas cyber-units headquarters in Gaza was destroyed in a so-called “bomb-back” mission[&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]. This is a turning point in modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Here is the video released by the IDF showing the air-strike against the building housing Hamas cyber forces. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uHm2ZYa4AP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uHm2ZYa4AP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Catalin Cimpanu (@campuscodi) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1125122680267603968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 5, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack was executed by an F-16 fighter airplane. It is currently unknown if the cyberattack was pinpointed to this location or if the IDF used previously acquired knowledge of the location to attack the cyber forces of Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future development and more details on the topic I want to refer to two of the thought leaders on cyber warfare: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thegrugq&quot;&gt;the grugq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2rIVdpMToM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyberpeace&quot;&gt;Cyberpeace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of the cyberspace as a domain of fighting wars has led to multiple efforts to control cyberweapons and surveillance technology. Initiatives include the disclosure of vulnerabilities, decentralization, encryption, and education. Policymakers in Europe are developing rules and norms for modern warfare including cyber. It has to be seen how the results of Cyberpeace efforts will affect the wars on this new battlefield of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the topics of Neuromancer have become a reality of our time and we see the beginning of developments that have been anticipated in the book. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence&quot;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg&quot;&gt;Cyborgs&lt;/a&gt; and Genetic Modifications are all on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in interesting times of Sci-Fi reality.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Security must start somewhere. This somewhere is a list of security principles. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are considered the primary goals and objectives of a security infrastructure. Security controls are measured on how well they address those core principles. How important each principle is to an organization depends on the security goals and requirements of a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cia_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mexican pyramid&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;confidentiality&quot;&gt;Confidentiality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidentiality protects the secrecy of data, objects, or resources. The goal is to prevent or minimize unauthorized access to data. An authorized user can access or interact with objects while Confidentiality actively prevents unauthorized users from doing so. Many security measures or controls support Confidentiality. Examples are encryption, access control, authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An object is the passive part in a security relationship, such as files, applications, computers, and network connections.
A subject is the active part in a security relationship, such as users, programs or computers.
The management of the relationship between object and subject is access control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For confidentiality to be maintained in a network, data needs to be protected from unauthorized access and disclosure while in transit, in program, and in storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific controls are required for each of these states of data, resources, and objects to maintain confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous attacks focus on the violation of confidentiality. Examples are capturing network traffic, stealing passwords, port scanning, privilege escalation, and social engineering. Violation of confidentiality (disclosure) is not limited to intentional attacks. Many times the cause for unauthorized disclosure are the result of human error and oversight. Events leading to disclosure include failing to encrypt a transmission, accessing malicious code, walking away from a computer while sensitive data is displayed on the screen, misconfigured security control, or oversight in a security policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous countermeasures help to ensure confidentiality. These include encryption, network traffic monitoring, strict access control, authentication, data classification, and ownership, or training of personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidentiality and Integrity are depending on each other. Without object integrity, confidentiality cannot be maintained. Integrity means the inability of an object to be modified without permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidentiality concepts, conditions, and aspects include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the damage caused by the disclosure of data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticality&lt;/strong&gt; defines how important an object is for the functionality of an organization&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secrecy&lt;/strong&gt; describes the act of preventing disclosure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt; refers to keeping personally identifiable data confidential&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations need to evaluate the level of confidentiality they wish to enforce on objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;integrity&quot;&gt;Integrity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrity is the concept of protecting the reliability and correctness of data. Integrity protection prevents unauthorized changes to data. It ensures that data remains correct, unaltered, and preserved. Well implemented integrity provides the functionality of authenticated change while it prevents intended and malicious unauthorized activities as well as mistakes by authorized users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objects must retain their correctness and can only be intentionally changed by authenticated users, in order to maintain integrity. Integrity mechanism and protection provide a high level of assurance that the data, object, and resources are unaltered from their original protected state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unauthorized and unwanted changes should not occur while an object is in storage, in transit, or in process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cia_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;integrity right wrong&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrity is checked from three perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preventing unauthorized subjects from making modifications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preventing authorized subjects from making unauthorized changes (mistakes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maintaining consistency of objects so that their data is correct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain integrity on a system, controls must be in place to restrict access to data, objects, and resources. Activity logging must be employed to verify that only authorized users are able to access their respective resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some example of attacks against the violation of integrity are viruses, coding errors, malicious modifications, and backdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in confidentiality, the attacks on integrity are not always intentional. Human errors, lack of oversight, or improperness can cause unauthorized alteration of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many countermeasures to support the integrity approach in security. Access control, authentication, intrusion detection, encryption, hashing, interface restrictions, input verification, training of personnel. Integrity is depending on confidentiality and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrity concepts, conditions, and aspects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accuracy&lt;/strong&gt; is correct and precise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truthfulness&lt;/strong&gt; is a true reflection of reality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authenticity&lt;/strong&gt; refers to genuine and authentic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accountability&lt;/strong&gt; means being responsible for actions and results&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt; refers to being in charge of having control over a subject or object&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensiveness&lt;/strong&gt; the complete scope of all elements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonrepudiation&lt;/strong&gt; is not being able to deny having performed an activity or action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validity&lt;/strong&gt; is factual and logically correct&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;availability&quot;&gt;Availability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last principle of the triad is availability. It refers to authorized subjects have timely and uninterrupted access to objects. Availability implies that infrastructure, like network services or authentication systems, is functional and allows authorized users to gain authorized access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For availability to be maintained, controls need to be in place to ensure an acceptable level of performance, to handle interruption, to be redundant, to maintain functional backups, and to prevent data loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example threats to availability are device failure, environmental issues, software and hardware errors, (D)DoS ((Distributed) Denial of Service) attacks, and communication interruptions. As with confidentiality and integrity, violations of availability are not limited to intentional attacks. Examples are overutilizing hardware or software component, mislabeling or incorrectly classifying objects, or accidentally deleting files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cia_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mexicani pyramid&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countermeasures to support availability are numerous and include monitoring of performance, monitoring of network traffic, monitoring of network bandwidth, redundancy for critical systems, maintaining and testing backup systems, (D)DoS protection systems, designing fault-tolerant systems, testing access control systems, removing single points of failure, and business continuity planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Availability depends on confidentiality and integrity and cannot be maintained without the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Availability concepts and aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability&lt;/strong&gt; refers to easy to learn, understand, control, and apply&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt; is the concept of a wide range of subjects can interact with an object&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeliness&lt;/strong&gt; means to provide low latency response or being within a reasonable timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cia-priority&quot;&gt;CIA Priority&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every organization has unique security requirements and the security needs have to be prioritized. Knowing which assets are more important than others guides the development of a dedicated security stance and the deployment of a security solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing with the CIA Triad is a good start and can be replicated for design, architecture, deployment, maintenance, and development.
The prioritization focuses the effort of an organization on one aspect over the others. It doesn’t mean that the second or third prioritised items are ignored or improperly addressed. Each individual organization decides its own security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Security Risk Assessment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Risk is a consequence of an action taken and can have a positive or negative outcome. It can be managed in 5 distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accepting&lt;/strong&gt; a risk means there are no actions. This is a valid approach but requires identification and documentation of the risk. The acceptance of a risk has to be done by a qualified person. Real-life example: Smoking, drinking or base jumping&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding&lt;/strong&gt; is a change of plans and not executing on a strategy, investment or software project because of the risk. Real-life example: Stick to the speed limit, not go bungee jumping&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer&lt;/strong&gt; of risk means another party, person or organization is taking the risk instead. Real-life example: insurance industry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation&lt;/strong&gt; against a risk is the most common approach. One can mitigate against the impact and or mitigate by reducing the likelihood. Real-life example: audits, backup, redundancy, error-tolerant design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploiting&lt;/strong&gt; is an option if the risk has a positive impact. Looking for ways to increase the likelihood and/or impact of a risk. Real-life example: using new technologies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All mentioned risk management approaches rely on a prior assessment. The assessment of the risk for an organization has to follow a structured approach.  Risk assessment and management is an essential part of security management. Security assessment methodologies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAMM&quot;&gt;CRAMM&lt;/a&gt; contain risk assessment modules. Risk assessment methodologies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEHARI&quot;&gt;Mehari&lt;/a&gt; have evolved to be security assessment methodologies. A systematic approach to security risk assessment is necessary to identify security requirements and to create an effective Information Security Management System (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001&quot;&gt;ISMS&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security risk assessments identify, quantify, and prioritize risks against defined criteria for risk management and objectives relevant to the organization.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/risk_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;symbolic picture for risk&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-to-run-security-risk-assessment&quot;&gt;When to run Security Risk Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever a new system, software, process or partner is connected to the organization. It’s essential to understand for example what data is shared and which privileged rights are implemented. A decision has to be made conscious and has to be aligned with the risk profile of a company.
Existing assessments have to be revisited on a regular basis to adapt to the ever-evolving security threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each risk assessment has to be tailored to the subject of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stories-from-the-trenches&quot;&gt;Stories from the trenches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A designer finds this new productivity tool on the internet and installs it on the company notebook. The tool turns out to be malware.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A manager is doing a test run with a new vendor and shares production data that turns out to include privacy protected data. The vendor is in a territory not bound to EU privacy laws and does not comply with GDPR&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Development teams use third-party modules for a software project. One module has malicious code injected (&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/software-supply-chain-security/&quot;&gt;software supply chain attack&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A company decides to go global without a global security framework. Later a foreign branch is hacked and the HQ is affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-cyber-security-risk-assessment&quot;&gt;Example Cyber Security Risk Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bank is evaluating a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The new system is a browser-based SaaS (Software as a service) solution. The new CRM software is part of a digitalization project in the bank with the purpose to reduce costs and improve customer relationship. The vendor of the SaaS solution was successfully approved after a vendor risk assessment. The contract with the SaaS provider includes SLA definitions and SLA monitoring metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We scope this risk assessment to only look at the Data, Network and Client. People and Client hardware availability has to be covered in a disaster recovery plan and according to corporate security requirements. Customer and Support Agent interaction has to follow security approved processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-no-1-identify-assets-and-define-the-scope&quot;&gt;Step No. 1: Identify Assets and define the scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The identification of the assets can includes hardware, software, data, and personnel. It’s important to work with business users and management to create a list of all valuable assets. A tech person might not have all the information necessary to identify the assets or potential consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s possible to define the scope of the assessment and recommend further assessments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/risk_table_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;asset table&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-no-2-identify-potential-consequences&quot;&gt;Step No. 2: Identify potential consequences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determine what financial and reputational losses the organization would suffer if a given asset were damaged. This will later be used to determine the impact of loss or unavailability of an asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Data&lt;/strong&gt;
As a financial institute the partial or complete loss of customer data has legal implications and has to be reported to the authorities. The reputational consequences are a loss of trust in the organization. A full or partial data breach has legal, reputational and financial implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client&lt;/strong&gt;
Because of the SaaS solution the agents only require a browser. Browsers have evolved into cloud-based password managers and provide access to extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network&lt;/strong&gt;
A stable network connection with low latency is required for the SaaS solution to work. Loss of the connection means downtime for the customer support department which implies reputational consequences. Prolonged downtimes will have financial impact on the organiziation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-no-3-identify-threats&quot;&gt;Step No. 3: Identify Threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A threat is anything that might exploit a vulnerability to breach your security and cause harm to your assets. Threats are specific to the company and derive from the company threat assessment. A bank of a certain size is considered critical infrastructure and is facing threats from computer criminals and state players. Natural disasters are also considered a threat but out of scope for this assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/risk_table_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;threat table&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-no-4-identify-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Step No. 4: Identify Vulnerabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is probably one of the most challenging aspects of the security risk assessment. Vulnerability analysis requires technical understanding, up to date knowledge about the security threat landscape and the ability to tie it all together on the use case. I am giving some examples here without claim for completeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/risk_table_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;vulnerability table&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-no-5-assess-the-risk&quot;&gt;Step No. 5: Assess the risk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk is the potential that a given threat will exploit the vulnerabilities of the environment and cause harm to one or more assets. 
It is important to document the justification or rationale for each impact assessment and probability of occurrence rating. If the conditions or environment change, the assessment might need to be revisited. The rationale helps to communicate the significance of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Risk = Threat Likelihood x Magnitude of Impact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of an event to occur can be defined by factoring in the capability and motivation of a threat and the existing controls to prevent a threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/risk_table_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Likelihood table&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of the impact by the value of the data or service and the impact a loss has for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/risk_table_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Impact table&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/risk_table_6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Risk table&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting risk management plan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/risk_table_7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Risk management plan&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this simplified risk assessment we can now decide on how the risk is managed. Most organizations will try to mitigate the risk and quantification helps to justify the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GDPR, Passwords, Hashing and You</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a legal expert and this article is my interpretation of the law and personal opinion. GDPR does not contain any specifics about passwords. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/security/passwords-in-online-services/&quot;&gt;UK Information Commissioner’s Office - ICO&lt;/a&gt; published a useful guide for the development of password protection systems after GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;password-systems-and-the-gdpr&quot;&gt;Password systems and the GDPR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passwords (low-entropy secrets) play a critical role in keeping information safe. For this reason, ensuring password security is critical. GDPR not only introduces the principles of &lt;strong&gt;privacy by design&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;privacy by default&lt;/strong&gt;, but in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/gdpr-article-32/&quot;&gt;Article 32&lt;/a&gt; it also defines the obligation for data security and data loss prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Access to personal data is protected by passwords. In order to protect personal data, passwords have to be protected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any password system developed or deployed has to be protected against &lt;strong&gt;brute force&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;guessing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/vulnerability-disclosure-at-signup/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;credential stuffing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attacks. The password itself is treated as personal data and requires state of the art protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the introduction of GDPR a German company reported a data breach in accordance with Article 33 GDRP to the authorities. During the investigation, it was discovered that the passwords have been stored in clear text. This was interpreted as a violation of Article 32 GDRP and the company was fined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/23/knuddels_fined_for_plain_text_passwords/&quot;&gt;EUR 20.000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By storing the passwords in clear text, the company knowingly violated its duty to ensure data security in the processing of personal data.” the authority said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company wasn’t fined for the breach but because of the password storage strategy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;state-of-the-art-methods-for-password-storage&quot;&gt;State of the art methods for password storage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under GDPR a strong password storage strategy is critical in mitigating data breaches. 
Hashing passwords is no longer just an option and the hashing method should be &lt;em&gt;state of the art&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements for the hashing method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The honest player needs to be able to compute a single instance of the algorithm on standard hardware for moderate costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The adversary should not be able to reduce costs by calculating multiple instances of the algorithm on customized hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The time for calculating the hash should not depend on the length of the password.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identical input has to produce a different output (nondeterministic).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One way function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is better than clear text but attackers have found ways around this implementation. If a couple of users were to use the same password, their hash would be identical. Multiple accounts mapped to the same hash indicate a commonly used password. With this knowledge, hackers can considerably narrow down the number of passwords used in an attack. Attackers can also utilize databases of pre-computed hashes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table&quot;&gt;rainbow table attacks&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salting the input increases the complexity of the output without increasing user requirements. A salt is a fixed-length cryptographically strong value added to the input. But fixed salt strings can get exposed in a data breach and the attacker can neglect the advantage of using a salt. This implementation also produces deterministic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BCrypt, PBKDF2 or SCrypt - key stretching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great improvement over the mentioned above methods but I do not recommend the commonly implemented BCrypt, PBKDF2 or SCrypt methods for newly designed systems anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BCrypt and PBKDF2&lt;/em&gt; are key stretching or key derivation functions and do not offer memory hardness. This means those methods are CPU bound and prone to password cracking by Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Whitepapers have emerged regarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot14/woot14-malvoni.pdf&quot;&gt;Energy-Efficient Bcrypt Cracking with Low-CostParallel Hardware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SCrypt&lt;/em&gt; adds memory-hard functions (MHFs). It is CPU and Memory intensive to calculate. But I see an issue with the usage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinpaprika.com/tag/scrypt?all=true&quot;&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. Mining solutions for SCrypt are &lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptomining-blog.com/10810-new-innosilicon-a6-ltc-master-2-2-ghs-scrypt-asic-miner/&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; and these could be repurposed for &lt;em&gt;offline cracking&lt;/em&gt;. SCrypt also doesn’t give many options to configure parameters to balance parameters. In my opinion, this is an important feature to tailor the method to your use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;argon2---appropriate-hashing&quot;&gt;Argon2 - appropriate hashing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation for a newly designed password storage system is argon2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open source implementations in all commonly used languages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has been around for a while&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;withstood studies to accelerate the algorithm on dedicated hardware&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;parameters to control execution time, memory requirements and degree of parallelism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://password-hashing.net/&quot;&gt;Password Hashing Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gdpr_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GDPR symbolic picture&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preventing-a-data-breach&quot;&gt;Preventing a data breach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hashing will protect passwords after a data breach. Other privacy information is usually stored in clear text.
The risk for a data breach can be reduced by implementing processes, controls, and audits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User rights management - Access control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Privileged user monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immutable audit trail for machines and humans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secure archiving for forensics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data access auditing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data discovery and classification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rate limiting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee background checks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encryption of private information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluation-process-with-gdpr&quot;&gt;Evaluation process with GDPR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDPR changes the requirements for engineers and we need to put more thought into designing a system.
Evaluation processes and decision making has to be documented along the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of the Art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the most advanced approach and measure it against the ever-evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.
Keep on learning, educate yourself, assess risks and anticipate attacks. Be aware of threats relevant for your use case.
A successful security strategy is never “done”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know your companies unique risk profile and customize your solutions accordingly. Risk profiles include core requirements for systems.
This profile has to be re-evaluated according to company changes or changes to the threat level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluate the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing of personal data. It is essential to understand what data is where and for which purpose.
Data might be the oil of the 21st century but minimizing the amount of collected data is required. Collect only data you need for business and legal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluate the costs of an implementation according to the risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I wanted to show how to satisfy GDRP requirements for password storage and what to take into consideration.
It’s fine to run a legacy system with BCrypt but when designing a new system we need to use technology with a high probability to stand the test of time. Or at least the next decade. It’s on us engineers to stay informed about the continuous evolution of cybersecurity threats and adapt our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Software Supply Chain Security</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-supply-chain&quot;&gt;The Supply Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development, platform technology, and delivery pipelines are a mission-critical element in every modern enterprise - and a place for security incidents. Increased velocity in software development, delivery and the removal of manual steps create additional security risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other industries have understood the need to manage risk along the supply chain a long time ago. Documenting the origin of raw materials, testing the quality of supplied materials and ensuring the integrity of their supply chains. Examples are the medical, automotive, aerospace and mechanical engineering industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/supply_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture of a container harbor&quot; style=&quot;float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the traditional supply chain security of the cargo industry. Threats are terrorism, theft and, piracy.
The activities to protect the supply chain include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Credentialing of participants in the supply chain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Screening and validating of the contents of cargo being shipped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advance notification of the contents to the destination country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring the security of cargo while in-transit via the use of locks and tamper-proof seals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Real-time tracking of the cargo while in-transit via GPS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inspecting cargo on entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing those efforts with the care being taken for the software supply chain in even big companies, illustrates the gap. Attackers have shifted their focus from operating systems and networks directly to applications and they don’t care how the weakness got there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;excuses-are-plenty---opportunities-are-rare&quot;&gt;Excuses are plenty - Opportunities are rare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially in the startup industry, there is a lot of pressure for delivery and little for security. Customer growth, agility, automation or product delivery are the key performance indicators. &lt;strong&gt;Ain’t nobody got time for software supply chain security&lt;/strong&gt; attitude has even been seen in the fintech and medtech industry. Nobody would admit this of course. Everybody takes security serious unless it collides with the mentioned above KPIs. It’s important to explain to non-technical decision makers the importance of risk reduction in the supply chain of the software product. Leaking data and industrial espionage are just two of many threats to companies with unchecked or weak software supply chain security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attack-vectors&quot;&gt;Attack vectors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;injecting malicious code in public repositories for common libraries, modules, and images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A software project consists nowadays of up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sonatype-reduces-licensing-risks-nuget-135123418.html&quot;&gt;90% of open source components&lt;/a&gt; and only 10% of custom code. Modern software development relies on large communities of open source developers to deliver building blocks for the companies own software product. I believe open source being superior to closed source software but companies have to understand that they can’t outsource their own risk to open source development teams and repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no enforced code reviews, commit right reviews or background checks on developers in open source. Companies need to start taking responsibility for the third party software they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious code has been found in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dockerhub&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;maven repository&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;npm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;outdated libraries, modules, and images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vector is the lack of tracking for software component versions. While third-party libraries with weaknesses are disclosed and updated, it’s frightening to know that most utilizing software of the components is not updated. Known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) have been found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-more-than-50-of-global-500-use-vulnerable-open-source-components/&quot;&gt;more than 50%&lt;/a&gt; of companies. The microservice architecture is counterproductive. Small specialized services are developed once and then left deserted for months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;third party failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today IT companies and startups are very specialized on a core business model and outsource to SaaS providers or insource specialized software. This is understandable from an efficiency and financial perspective. One doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel. But this also means that the vendors’ security becomes the security of their own company. Data breaches happen even with the big players. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3031566/github-bug-exposed-user-passwords-in-plaintext&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/07/03/typeform-data-breach-hits-thousands-of-survey-accounts/&quot;&gt;Typeform&lt;/a&gt;). This exposes data and user accounts without having done anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a breach companies struggle to determine the impact and the affected data. Remediation actions are delayed or wrongly planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ok-what-now&quot;&gt;Ok, what now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Companies have to understand how their respective software supply chain is structured.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pipelines and Systems need to be documented and governed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code components should be scanned during deployment against common vulnerabilities (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check&quot;&gt;OWASP dependency check&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jfrog.com/xray/&quot;&gt;Jfrog X-Ray&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access to public repositories has to be restricted and monitored. Local repositories or proxies are preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vetting of components and base images is required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software and component versions require documentation and automatic checks against CVE databases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third party software and partners have to be checked and their own software supply security needs to be verified. Due diligence of partners must involve a security assessment. A good name or reference is not enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ingress and egress traffic monitoring needs to be performed on a per-host basis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation of vendors and the data that is shared with them is a must.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deployments have to be monitored and the code change requires reference to the source code changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The technical debt of your partner is your technical debt!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strong security controls need to be implemented across the supply chain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detected vulnerabilities require swift remediation or whitelisting by experts as not applicable for the use case.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strengthen your QA specialists!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important action is to raise awareness with managers and decision makers. A data leak, prolonged downtime or a company breach can bring an end to all the ambitious growth goals company founders have. IT companies need to step up their game. We owe it to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
