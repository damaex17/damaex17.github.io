Increased velocity in software development, delivery and the removal of manual steps create additional security risks.</p> <p>Other industries have understood a long time ago the need to manage risk along the supply chain. Documenting the origin of raw materials, testing the quality of supplied materials and ensuring the integrity of their supply chains. Examples are the medical, automotive, aerospace and mechanical engineering industry.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/supply_1.jpg" alt="picture of a container harbor" style="float: center; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" /></p> <p>Let’s look at the traditional supply chain security of the cargo industry. Threats are terrorism, theft and piracy. The activities to protect the supply chain include:</p> <ul> <li>Credentialing of participants in the supply chain</li> <li>Screening and validating of the contents of cargo being shipped</li> <li>Advance notification of the contents to the destination country</li> <li>Ensuring the security of cargo while in-transit via the use of locks and tamper-proof seals</li> <li>Realtime tracking of the cargo while in-transit via GPS</li> <li>Inspecting cargo on entry</li> </ul> <p>Comparing those efforts with the care being taken for the software supply chain in even big companies, illustrates the gap. Attackers have shifted their focus from operating systems and networks directly to applications and they don’t care how the weakness got there in the first place.</p> <h3 id="excuses-are-plenty---opportunities-are-rare">Excuses are plenty - Opportunities are rare</h3> <p>Especially in the startup industry there is a lot of pressure for delivery and little for security. Customer growth, agility, automation or product delivery are the key performance indicators. <strong>Ain’t nobody got time for software supply chain security</strong> attitude has even been seen in the fintech and medtech industry. Nobody would admit this of course. Everybody takes security serious unless it collides with the mentioned above KPIs. It’s important to explain to non technical decision makers the importance of risk reduction in the supply chain of the software product. Leaking data and industrial espionage are just two of many threats to companies with unchecked or weak software supply chain security.</p> <h3 id="attack-vectors">Attack vectors</h3> <p><strong>injecting malicious code in public repositories for common libraries, modules and images</strong></p> <p>Software consists nowadays up to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sonatype-reduces-licensing-risks-nuget-135123418.html">90% of open source components</a> and only 10% of custom code. Modern software development relies on large communities of open source developers to deliver building blocks for the companies own software product. I believe open source being superior to closed source software but companies have to understand that they can’t outsource their own risk to open source development teams and repositories.</p> <p>There are no enforced code reviews, commit right reviews or background checks on developers in open source. Companies need to start taking responsibility for the third party software they use.</p> <p>Malicious code has been found in:</p> <ul> <li>github</li> <li>dockerhub</li> <li>maven repository</li> <li>npm</li> <li>pip</li> </ul> <p><strong>outdated libraries, modules and images</strong></p> <p>Another vector is the lack of tracking for software component versions. While third party libraries with weaknesses are disclosed and updated, it’s frightening to know that most utilizing software of the components is not updated. Known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) have been found in <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-more-than-50-of-global-500-use-vulnerable-open-source-components/">more than 50%</a> of companies. The microservice architecture is counter productive. Small specialized services are developed once and then left deserted for months.</p> <p><strong>third party failure</strong></p> <p>Today IT companies and startups are very specialized on a core business model and outsource to SaaS providers or insource specialized software. This is understandable from an efficiency and financial perspective. One doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel. But this also means that the vendors security becomes the security of the own company. Data breaches happen even with the big players. (<a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3031566/github-bug-exposed-user-passwords-in-plaintext">Github</a>, <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/07/03/typeform-data-breach-hits-thousands-of-survey-accounts/">Typeform</a>). This exposes data and user accounts without having done anything wrong.</p> <p>After a breach companies struggle to determine the impact and the affected data. Remediation actions are delayed or wrongly planned.</p> <h3 id="ok-what-now">Ok, what now?</h3> <ul> <li>Companies have to understand how their respective software supply chain is structured.</li> <li>Pipelines and Systems need to be documented and governed.</li> <li>Code components should be scanned during deployment against common vulnerabilities (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check">OWASP dependency check</a>, <a href="https://jfrog.com/xray/">Jfrog X-Ray</a>).</li> <li>Access to public repositories has to be restricted and monitored. Local repositories or proxies are preferred.</li> <li>Vetting of components and base images is required.</li> <li>Software and component versions require documentation and automatic checks against CVE databases.</li> <li>Third party software and partners have to be checked and their own software supply security needs to be verified. Due diligence of partners must involve a security assessment. A good name or a reference is not enough.</li> <li>Ingress and egress traffic monitoring needs to be performed on a per host basis.</li> <li>Documentation of vendors and the data that is shared with them is a must.</li> <li>Deployments have to be monitored and the code change requires reference to the source code changes.</li> <li>Technical debt of your partner is your technical debt!</li> <li>Strong security controls need to be implemented across the supply chain.</li> <li>Detected vulnerabilities require swift remediation or whitelistng by experts as non applicable for the use case.</li> <li>Strengthen your QA specialists!</li> </ul> <p>The most important action is to raise awareness with managers and decision makers. A data leak, prolonged downtime or a company breach can bring an end to all the ambitious growth goals company founders have. IT companies need to step up their game. We owe it to our customers.</p> </div> <span><div style="text-align:center">[ <a href="/tag/security/"><code class="highligher-rouge"><nobr>security</nobr></code></a> ]</div></span> <aside class="share"> <div style="text-align:center"><p>If you liked this article, please share it on <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Software Supply Chain Security&amp;url=https://inversegravity.net/2019/software-supply-chain-security/&amp;via=" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'twitter-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">Twitter</a></p></div> </aside> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">&copy; 2019 Maximilian Weber &middot; &lt;/&gt; Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> </small> </div> </footer> </main> <script type="text/javascript"> var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-138082100-1']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
